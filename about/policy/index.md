  * *Section 3.A.* - Public websites must have a search function.
  * *Section 9.D.* - Federal websites must use domains within the .gov or .mil top level domains, and any domains in a different top level domain must be approved for use and [registered with the Search.gov list of non-governmental domains]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/policy/govt-urls.html).
* *[P.L. 115-336: 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/)* § 3(a)(4) - New websites and digital services must have a search function that allows the public to easily discover public information. In order to achieve this goal, this section is often interpreted broadly as also requiring good technical SEO (search engine optimization) practices, to support the search process.
