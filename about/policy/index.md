This page provides an overview of the laws and policies Search.gov works to support.

* *[OMB M-17-06: Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf)*
  * *Section 3.A.* - Public websites must have a search function.
  * *Section 9.D.* - Federal websites must use domains within the .gov or .mil top level domains. Any domains in a different top level domain must be approved for use by the agency's CIO and registered with the [Search.gov list of non-governmental domains]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/policy/govt-urls.html).
* *[P.L. 115-336: 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/)* § 3(a)(4) - New websites and digital services must have a search function that allows the public to easily discover public information. This section is often interpreted broadly as also requiring good technical SEO (search engine optimization) practices, to support the search process.
