## Overview

Most U.S. government websites end in .gov or .mil, but some end in .com, .org, .net, or other top-level domains. To enhance discoverability and public trust, we maintain a [list](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/) of known government domains that *don't* end in .gov or .mil. Federal executive branch agencies must ensure their non-.gov or .mil domains are on the list. Read more in the [Federal Zero Trust Strategy](https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/federal-zero-trust-strategy/#4-safely-making-applications-internet-accessible) and [Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf#page=11).

The list is used by several U.S. government services, including USA.gov to support their all-of-government search, and the .gov Registry to support an inventory of government domains.

Anyone can [submit](#non-gov-domain-collector) a domain to the list.

## What domains are in scope of this list?

All non-.gov and non-.mil domain names registered by your agency, or by a contractor on behalf of your agency, must be included in this list. This includes domains that are not even used on the internet but are merely registered.

{: .usa-table .usa-table--compact}
| Domain Description | Example |
| :------------------------ | :------------- |
| Registered to facilitate redirects | **agency.com** which may redirect to agency.gov |
| Serve some infrastructure purpose, <br />even if not public-facing | **agencyapi.com** <br /> **agency-dashboard.net** |
| Registered by a contractor on behalf of the agency | **agencycampaignsite.us** |
| Registered long ago and is not expired | **legacyagency.org** |
| Registered to prevent others from obtaining it <br />(sometimes called "defensive registrations", which includes "typo" domains) | **ouragency.com** <br /> **0uragency.com** <br /> **houragency.com** |

Do not add individual subdomains or hostnames within a domain that's already on the list. For example, report *agency.com*, but do not also report *saas.agency.com*.

Report a "subdomain" if (1) your agency has a domain registered on a country-code top-level domain (or other "[public suffix](https://publicsuffix.org/)") or (2) your agency publishes federal information on nongovernmental domains that you do not operate.

{: .usa-table .usa-table--compact}
| Domain Description | Example |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Registered on a country-code top level domain | **us-agency.org.uk** |
| Subdomains publishing federal information | **exampleagency.university.edu** |

### Domains registered by grantees

Generally, report a domain if it is registered pursuant to the terms of a grant and used for federal purposes, but do not report domains registered by grantees which your agency does not oversee or technologically support.

## What domains are out of scope of this list?

This list **excludes** the domains of third-party online services where the agency is merely a user or a customer, not the domain's registrant.

{: .usa-table .usa-table--compact}
| Domain Description | Example |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Software-as-a-service sites | **agency-my.sharepoint.com** <br /> **agency-service.slack.com** |
| Cloud-managed resources | **s3.amazonaws.com** |
| Social media sites | **twitter.com** <br /> **linkedin.com** |
| Code repositories | **github.com/agency** |

## How to Update the List

1.  **Gather domain names**. Domains are sometimes confused for "websites", so consider asking for a "list of websites/domain registrations we manage" from the following types of roles:
    * External affairs, web publishing, or press team.
    * DNS managers, network/security operations.
    * Budget or accounting teams who might process domain registration payments to registrars like GoDaddy, Network Solutions, Namecheap, etc.<br /><br />If you have questions about whether a certain domain should be included, [open an issue](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/issues) in Github or [email us](mailto:search@gsa.gov).<br /><br />

1.  **Send your updates.** We will review all submissions before including them on the list.
    * For *multiple additions* or any *changes:*
        * [Open an issue](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/issues) in GitHub. No technical knowledge or code is required, but a GitHub account is. You can also open pull requests.
        * Submit bulk changes [via email](mailto:search@gsa.gov) using our [template]({{ site_baseurl }}/files/non-gov-submission-template.csv) (.csv format).
    * For *single additions*, use this form:
