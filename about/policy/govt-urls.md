## Overview

As the U.S. government's official web portal, [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/) searches across all federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government websites. Most government websites end in .gov or .mil, but many end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains.

In support of USA.gov and [M-17-06 &ndash; Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf), Search.gov maintains a list of all public government domains that don't end in .gov or .mil.

## How to Update the List

Federal agencies [are required](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) to submit to Search.gov all non-.gov websites for inclusion in the list. This includes subdomains of a second-level domain managed by a third party, and federally controlled subfolders of a domain managed by a third party.

* Review the [list of federal non-.gov domains](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls)
  * You can also search for specific domains using the search box at the top of the page.
  * Quasi-governmental entities are [listed here](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/blob/master/8_govt_urls_quasigovernmental_only.csv).
* To submit updates, you can [open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/issues), or [email them to Search.gov](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov), such as notice of decommissioned sites, or updates to existing domains. Any new sites [must use a .gov or .mil domain](https://policy.cio.gov/web-policy/domain/).

State or local agencies can browse the list by [by level of government](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/), you can sort by state by downloading the .csv file to your computer. Please [email updates or additions to the Search team](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov), or [open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/issues).
