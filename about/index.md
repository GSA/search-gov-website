Search.gov is a by-government, for-government web search engine. Available at no cost to federal agencies and the District of Columbia, we currently support the search boxes on about 2,200 websites, across 30% of federal domains. We are a product of Smarter IT Solutions, a division of the U.S. General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Services, 

Our mission is to connect the public with the information they need from the government. 

We work to provide a modern, high quality, government-wide, self-service search engine that allows agencies to customize search experiences for the public, regardless of website type or organization.


## History

Search.gov got its start when Internet entrepreneur Eric Brewer, whose early research was funded by the Department of Defense, offered to donate a powerful search engine to the government. That gift helped accelerate the government’s earlier work to create a government-wide portal.

In June 2000, President Clinton announced the gift from the Federal Search Foundation, a nonprofit organization established by Brewer, and instructed that an official U.S. web portal be launched within 90 days. USA.gov went online on September 22, 2000 under the name FirstGov.gov with a prominent search box to allow the public to search across government websites. Visit USA.gov to learn more about its mission and history.
In 2010, Search.gov moved to open-source software and became available to agencies across government in the United States to power the search boxes on their site. Today we power nearly 300 million queries a year through over 1,800 federal search configurations.
