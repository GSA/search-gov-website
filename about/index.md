Search.gov is a search engine built by the government, for the government. Available to federal agencies and the District of Columbia, we currently support over 300 million search queries a year for about 2,200 websites, across one third of federal domains.

Our mission is to connect the public with the information they need from the government. 

We work to provide a modern, high quality, government-wide, self-service search engine that allows agencies to customize search experiences for the public, regardless of website type or organization.

Search.gov is a product of Smarter IT Solutions, a division of the [U.S. General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/tts-solutions#smart), and there is no cost to federal agencies.

## History

Search.gov got its start when internet entrepreneur Eric Brewer, whose early research was funded by the Department of Defense, offered to donate a powerful search engine to the government. That gift helped accelerate the government’s earlier work to create a government-wide portal.

In June 2000, President Clinton announced the gift from the Federal Search Foundation, a nonprofit organization established by Brewer, and instructed that an official U.S. web portal be launched within 90 days. USA.gov went online on September 22, 2000 under the name FirstGov.gov with a [prominent search box](https://web.archive.org/web/20001109105200/http://www.firstgov.gov) to allow the public to search across government websites.

In 2010, Search.gov moved to open-source software and expanded its use to agencies across government in the United States.
