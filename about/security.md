System security is a top priority for Search.gov. We manage incoming requests to our customers’ search boxes, supporting security government wide.

We have an ATO (Authorization to Operate) issued by the General Services Administration. Active customers can request a meeting to review security package documentation. Please [contact us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) with any questions.
