System security is a top priority for Search.gov. We manage incoming requests to our customersâ€™ search boxes, supporting security government wide.

We have an ATO (Authorization to Operate) from the General Services Administration. Active customers can request a meeting to review security package documentation. Please [contact us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) with any questions.
