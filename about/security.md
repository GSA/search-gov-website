System security is a top priority for Search.gov. When you connect your search box to our service, we handle the incoming request load. You can be confident in our performance and security posture.

We have an ATO (Authorization to Operate) from the General Services Administration. Active customers can request a meeting to review security package documentation. Please [contact us](mailto:search@gsa.gov) with any questions.
