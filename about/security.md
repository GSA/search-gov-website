System security is a top priority for Search.gov. In our position behind the search box input on our customersâ€™ websites, we support security government wide. We have an ATO (Authorization to Operate) issued by the General Services Administration, our parent agency. Active agency customers can request a meeting to review security package documentation. Please [contact us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) with any questions.
