System security is a top priority for Search.gov, and our position behind the search input on our customersâ€™ websites means that our strength supports security government wide. We have an ATO (Authorization to Operate) issued by the General Services Administration, our parent agency. Active agency customers of Search.gov can request a meeting to review security package documentation. Please [contact us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) with any questions.
