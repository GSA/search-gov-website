Every month we publish [release notes]({{site.baseurl}}/about/updates/releases/), highlighting the improvements weâ€™ve made to our technology. The biggest changes in 2021 revolved around system security and legacy code cleanup, paving the way for new feature development in 2022.

* **Indexing Improvements:** We now visit sitemaps to scan for new and updated content every 2 hours. We made updates to our backend infrastructure to make it easier to manually queue URLs for indexing. We also improved the performance and stability of our indexing process.
* **Localizations Update:** We moved management of multilingual support from the GSA/Punchcard repository to the GSA/search-gov repository.
* **Legacy code removals:** We removed the old results display code environment, clearing the path for our results page redesign. We also removed support for the legacy V1 `/api/search/` endpoint.
* **Security updates:** We improved security settings on our session cookies, input validation in certain fields in the Admin Center, security of our third-party integrations, and performed many gem upgrades, changes, and removals to maintain a secure environment.
* **System upgrades:** Ruby, Rails, Elasticsearch, MySQL, jQuery.
* **System load management:** We improved our ability to block unwanted queries and react to flux in traffic. We also implemented auto-scaling on portions of our infrastructure.
