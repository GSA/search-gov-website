        <h2 id="">1. Baseline site assessment: Customer experience and usability research</h2>

        <h3>Impact on search</h3>
        <p>Baseline usability research reveals the strengths and shortcomings of the current website, including the search function. It highlights gaps in findability, which will show</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Needed changes to information architecture or updates to content;</li>
            <li>The need for more metadata for content; and </li>
            <li>Updates to the search experience, to help people find what they need.</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Redesigning a website is a journey. Like all journeys, you have to know where you are starting from.</p>
        <p>Ideally, a usability research team will conduct tests with users and review the current state of the website, including content and governance. This allows them to develop a clear picture of how people think about the website, what they are trying to accomplish with it, what they find easy, and what they find challenging.</p>
        <p>This is true for both usability and governance review. This information will outline the path ahead and ensure the team improves the public’s experience, while keeping features that already work well.</p>
        <p>However, this type of dedicated research requires resources, and not all web teams have access to usability research tools and participant pools. Budget or software approval requirements may constrain access. These teams can still do meaningful research using modified or combined methods.</p>
        <p>The techniques we see most often include card sorting, behavioral research, user interviews, and web analytics review:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Card sorting uses online tools, or in person with paper cards. Researchers present terms used on the website in menus or links, and participants sort them into groups that make sense to them. This activity can influence navigation design as well as search experience design, offering categories that will match more closely how people understand the website.</li>
            <li>Behavioral research involves the researcher observing the participants as they try to complete tasks on the website, listening to the participants’ comments about their experience, and sometimes asking questions. This can be done in person or using online tools. Some online services allow participants to engage in the study independently, or with the researcher. </li>
            <li>User interviews and survey feedback help researchers understand people’s experience. Interviews allow the researchers to go into detail with participants, while surveys provide structured input from a broad population sample. The challenge with interviews is in reaching a representative group. Survey data, especially from online surveys, may require teams to filter out invalid responses from bots.</li>
            <li>Web analytics show how many people visited the site, which pages they went to, how long they were on each page, what device browser they used, and many other aspects of interaction with the site. Reviewing analytics allows the web team to determine which pages are used most often, and which pages are used less. This data helps prioritize content additions and updates, and archiving pages that are no longer needed. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="">2. Content management system or publishing platform choice</h2>
        <blockquote class="year-in-review padding-x-4 padding-y-2 margin-x-0">
        <h3>Impact on search</h3>
        <p>Search engines are programmed to collect data and content in specific ways, and each one is different. Presenting relevant information about a page in the HTML elements that the search engine is looking for will help the page rank appropriately in results. Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of tailoring the elements placed on a page and the information included in them to support search engine bots’ data harvesting. Different content management systems provide different levels of SEO support.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Early in a site redesign, you need to decide what tool, or tools, that the new website will use. The tool has implications for everything in a design:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The public experience of using the site;</li>
            <li>The team managing the site’s content and technology; and</li>
            <li>The site’s security, compliance, and authorization to operate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some agencies have a central team managing a shared content management system (CMS) environment. Agency policy may require websites to migrate into the shared platform, or may allow websites to not use the system</p>
        <p>Different content management systems bring different approaches to publication workflows and feature enhancements. Some systems have robust SEO plugins that transform a page’s content and metadata into the right structures and make it easier for search engines to collect and rank the page in results.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, some systems automate very little of this transformation, so the web team must write the code that makes it happen, or decide to go without these SEO boosts.</p>
        <p>Even something as simple as URL construction can vary widely between content management systems. Search engines prefer URLs that are easy for people to read, so they can use the text in the URL for matching and ranking. For example, a content management system may construct a URL using the page ID, such as “<a href="www.gsa.gov/content/130981">www.gsa.gov/content/130981</a>,” which doesn’t carry meaning. But “<a href="www.gsa.gov/plainlanguage">www.gsa.gov/plainlanguage</a>” tells the searcher what to expect to find when they arrive on the page.</p>
        <p>Choosing a new publishing platform may or may not include choosing a new content management system. It may simply involve choosing a new version to upgrade to. Even so, different versions of the same content management system may have different SEO support options. Some sites choose to migrate to a new platform without redesigning the site at all.</p>

        <h3>Department of the Interior DOI.gov</h3>
        <p>For the Department of the Interior, many internal and external factors influence the timing of when they upgrade their website. While they knew they would upgrade and stay within the same system, the uncertain timeline meant they needed to decide which major version they would upgrade to.</p>
        <p>If they chose the earlier version, they needed to balance between a version that has been available long enough to complete minor updates, but not so long that that version’s end of life date was imminent. No agency likes to be forced into an immediate next upgrade.</p>
        <p>Moving directly to the next version too early may mean that that release isn’t fully stable.</p>
        <p>As with all major version changes, the two versions had significant differences. They have different features requiring different work required to upgrade them.</p>
        <p>The team would need alternative upgrade plans depending on what version they finally chose. . In the end, they chose to move to the newer version, looking at the likely production release date and the earlier version’s end of life date.</p>

        <h2 id="">3. Relaunch path selection</h2>
        <blockquote class="year-in-review padding-x-4 padding-y-2 margin-x-0">
        <h3>Impact on search</h3>
        <p>Update any search index when you launch the new website. If you relaunch your website in multiple waves, you will need to reindex the site with each wave, to ensure that search results stay correct.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You have two primary ways to relaunch your website: big bang or phased:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Big bang — relaunch the entire website all at once, or</li>
            <li>Phased approach —launch parts of the website incrementally. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consider the website’s size and complexity, and agency goals for the relaunch.</p>
        <p>Another factor is the scope of the team that manages the website. Most agency web teams are responsible for a single website. Some teams manage the publishing platform for multiple sites, but do not own the sites themselves. These multi-site environments often publish the individual sites on different subdomains. In these cases, relaunching one subdomain is managed separately from the others. A given subdomain may relaunch in waves, or all at once, depending on size and complexity.</p>
        <p>For phased relaunches, the team must decide how much content to move in each wave, and what will happen with the old content, if anything. Some agencies choose to move just a portion of their content, and leave the old pages entirely alone until they have been migrated into the new system. Other agencies choose to move just a portion of their content into the new system, but update the look and feel of the old system to match the new site’s design.</p>
        <p>Consider an agency’s web archiving policy. Some agencies archive their website every four years and launch a new one as a matter of course. Some agencies relaunch and archive less often. Some agencies relaunch without a separate public archive site. When agencies maintain a separate archive website, it needs to be searchable.</p>
        <p>Any legacy information related to current programs must be updated and included on the new website as well.</p>
        <p>We have worked with agencies who have moved the most current available information about an issue into their archive, and then experienced challenges getting it to show up in search. Some agencies choose to provide an archive-specific search; some agencies include the archive site as an alternative within their main search. In either case, agencies need to support searchers as they move back and forth between the two environments in case what they're looking for is stored on the other website.</p>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/updates/year-in-review/2022/img/HRSA_Logo.png" alt="Health Resources and Services Administration" />
        <h3>Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA.gov</h3>
        <p>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) team manages multiple subdomains as components of the larger HRSA.gov website, 12 sites in total. Each subdomain has distinct content, audiences, and subject matter experts. They chose to approach their overarching redesign as one project with multiple phases for the component websites. They created an overall project plan and calendar, considering each site’s size, complexity, and the priorities of the relevant bureaus and offices.</p>
        <p>For each subdomain, they took a big bang approach, relaunching all content on that subdomain at once. The phases overlapped each other, so that when one site got past the content review stage, the team would start work on the next site. Importantly, with the rolling subdomain approach, they took time to learn from each launch. They were able to apply lessons learned from one wave to the next, making each round an improvement over the last.</p>
        <p>They contacted our team at the beginning of their redesign process to review plans, and we offered feedback. When they had implementations in place, we assisted in the technical review. After the subdomains were complete, the main HRSA.gov site was relaunched. By this final launch, the team had refined all of their technical and procedural plans and was running the migrations, and only needed to send us notice of the area being relaunched, and the date. This “rolling big bang” hybrid approach allowed the HRSA team to effectively manage internal resources, focusing on just one set of stakeholders at a time, while keeping up a steady pace accomplishing major milestones and ultimately completing the project on time.</p>
