## Overview

At Search.gov we aim to provide an excellent public search experience, a self-service search administration experience, and a rock-solid secure and compliant infrastructure to support it all, while keeping costs down across the government.

We know it's helpful for our partners at federal agencies to know what’s coming up next, to support planning for your own web platforms. 

This roadmap shows what we are working on now, and what we plan to be working after that. We’ll update this roadmap quarterly.
