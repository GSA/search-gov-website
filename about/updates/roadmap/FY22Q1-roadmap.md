## Overview

At Search.gov we aim to provide an excellent public search experience, a self-service search administration experience, and a rock-solid secure and compliant infrastructure to support it all, while keeping costs down across the government.

We know it's helpful for our partners at federal agencies to know what's coming up next, to support planning for your own web platforms. 

This roadmap shows what we are working on now, and what we plan to be working after that. We'll update this roadmap quarterly.


## FY 2022 Q1: October&ndash;December 2021

### Now

* **Version Upgrades**
  * We will be upgrading our Rails, ElasticSearch, and Ruby versions to keep them up-to-date and compliant. 
* **Search.gov website redesign**
  * We will be launching a new design that aligns with the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), in accordance with the [21st Century IDEA](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/). The new site includes improved navigation and expanded documentation.
* **Continuity of Operations Plan Improvements** 
  * We are taking steps to bolster our system's resiliance and reliability.
* **Privacy Improvements**
  * We are scoping ways to improve the privacy of user-inputted data into our search boxes
* **New Developer Onboarding**
  * We are onboarding additional developers in support of our FY22 upcoming projects

### Next

* **Results page redesign**
  * We will begin to develop the new design and determine our best rollout strategy.
* **Scoping Faceted Search**
  * We are excited to announce we've gotten resourcing to support building faceted search, the ability to filter your search results by different categories. We will begin scoping the backend and frontend work required to support this functionality.
* **Version Upgrades**
  * We will continue work on ElasticSearch and Ruby upgrades to keep them up-to-date.

### Later

* **Results Page Redesign Rollout**
* **Develop Faceted Search**
