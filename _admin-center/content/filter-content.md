Find it in the Admin Center: [Search.gov Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Content > [Domains]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/content/domains.html) > Advanced > Filter URLs

You can filter *a single URL* from the results on your site. Use it for emergency reasons only (such as spillage of classified information or unintentional publication of a page). Note that this option should be used only if the [other options]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/content/domains.html#filter) aren't feasible as it can have an undesired effect on other features such as the display of spelling suggestions and relevance ranking.

It is not meant to fix the results for entire site, such as for launch or redesign problems. For tips on how to fix these more systemic problems, read our [Checklist for a Successful Website Redesign]({{ site.baseurl }}/indexing/redesign.html).

Entire the full path of the URL, e.g. use https://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Benefits.shtml, not usa.gov/citizen/topics.

You can later use the delete option to remove the filter.

Please note: this filtering only affects your search results page that is hosted by our service &mdash; it does not affect commercial web results on Google.com, Bing.com, etc.
