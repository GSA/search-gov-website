## Standard Response

Our standard No Results response is *Sorry, no results found for 'QueryTerms'. Try entering fewer or broader query terms*. This response will display whenever there are no results for a query.

## Additional Guidance Text

You can add text to guide searchers to additional resources. If you leave this field blank, the Alternative Links will display immediately after the standard response.

## Alternative Links

You can add links to alternative resources that may assist the searcher in answering their query. See, for instance, [this search on USA.gov for "avinaweoinasdv"](https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&query=avinaweoinasdv).
