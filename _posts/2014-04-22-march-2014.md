## Highlighted Features

### Feature 1. We migrated from Solr to Elasticsearch.

Open source search technology has improved rapidly in recent years. To keep pace, we upgraded from Solr to [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/).

We've realized many benefits. Loren Siebert, one of our software engineers, [recently presented]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/search-big-data.html) on some lessons we've learned and the evolution of open source search technology in general.

### Feature 2. We're continuing to go responsive.

Based your feedback, searchers now see a larger logo when they search from their desktop computers.

## Chores

* The option to narrow results to images only is now opt-in. To override the default, turn on the images sidebar option on the [Display Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/display/display-overview.html) page in the Admin Center.
* We sped up the cron job that generates the monthly and weekly CSV files on the [Monthly Reports]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/analytics/monthly-reports.html) page in the Admin Center.
* We prototyped using the [ELK stack](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/) ( [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/elasticsearch), [Logstash](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/logstash) and [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana)) for our search analytics.
* We fixed our [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) builds.
* We upgraded to Elasticsearch 1.0.1.
* We now route traffic evenly between our two datacenters.

## Fixes

* The last two columns are no longer dropped when you bulk upload [text best bets]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/content/best-bets.html).
* Searchers no longer get intermittently "stuck" on page one of the results.
* Searchers no longer lose their spot on the results page after they opt to see more job openings.
