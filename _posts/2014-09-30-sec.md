> I love the new *Federal Register* feature box that shows me additional results from my search query from the *Federal Register*. It's like having two searches in one! The "More documents on FederalRegister.gov" link also passes my query directly to the *Federal Register* API so I can move seamlessly to the FR site to continue my research. This is very helpful.
