*InformationWeek* yesterday [recognized 15 government agencies](http://www.informationweek.com/news/galleries/government/leadership/231600939) for taking on ambitious IT initiatives in an effort to provide better services at a lower cost.

Former federal CIO Vivek Kundra talked often about the technology gap that separates government workers from private-sector employees. Federal, state, and local government agencies have many initiatives under way in an effort to close that gap.

They're employing cloud computing, software as a service, the Web, mobile technologies, and more to give government workers the tools they need to be more productive and to deliver public services more efficiently.

GSA's DigitalGov Search (formerly USASearch) was one of those honored by *InformationWeek* for making government services in English and in Spanish more accessible online with a revamped version of DigitalGov Search and its set of advanced search technologies for [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov). Noted was our use of Microsoft's Bing Index, open source technologies such MySQL, Hadoop, and OpenCalais, and employing agile development to deliver new features quickly.
