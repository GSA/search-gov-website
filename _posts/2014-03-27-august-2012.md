## Highlighted Feature: Drupal 7 module now available

If you're using Drupal, be sure to check out our updated [Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch). It includes a new development branch for version 6 and and a release for version 7. Thanks, [Tim Wood](https://www.drupal.org/user/457434) at the Department of Commerce!

## Other features

* Searchers can now narrow their results by up to three additional facets&mdash;contributor, publisher, or subject. To start using this feature, simply update any of your [RSS feeds](/manual/rss.html) to include these Dublin Core properties. 
* Searchers are able to show and hide options (e.g., the time filter) from the sidebar on the results page.
* You can now add only one [Javascript snippet](/manual/code.html) to your web pages (versus two separate snippets).
* *Coming soon, a Forms GovBox.* Similar to our existing agency and [health](/manual/govbox-health.html) GovBoxes, we're currently working on rolling out a forms GovBox to help searchers find federal government forms. If you have forms metadata in a structured format, and want to have your visitors see them in search results, please [send us an email](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov).

## Chores

Over the past few weeks, we finished a long list of summer chores and we're happy to have a clear deck to offer you more features in the coming months.

We upgraded our environment to [Rails 3.2](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/1/20/rails-3-2-0-faster-dev-mode-routing-explain-queries-tagged-logger-store){% external_link %}. This upgrade ensures continued stability and allows us to maintain our record of exceeding our service level agreements.

We also changed our back-end logic for indexing your content. We now index secure (https) content. We also now allow you to give instructions to our user agent in your [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html){% external_link %} file.

Don't forget to check out your July search stats&mdash;in your email inbox or via the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/).

## Other Chores

* We upgraded to Ruby 1.9.3.
* We updated the [health GovBox](/manual/govbox-health.html) to account for changes in the [MedlinePlus XML files](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/xml.html).
* We investigated features and functionality of [Google BigQuery](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/){% external_link %}.
* We investigated additional tools to monitor our application and the speed of our results.

## Fixes
* We fixed broken URLs for YouTube thumbnails.
* We fixed an invalid byte sequence in UTF-8.
* We fixed the alt text on our Results by images.
* We fixed the z-index so that type-ahead suggestions always appear on top of other page elements. We also updated the CSS for our type-ahead to ensure it doesn't conflict with your CSS.
* We fixed our recalls API to return the expected response and to handle null values for recalled_on.
