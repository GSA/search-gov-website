## Highlight: Compare Your Click-thru Rate to the Average Rate

How do you stack up? You can now compare your click-thru rate (CTR) with the average rate across all sites that use DigitalGov Search. Use your CTR data to measure the performance of specific campaigns and modules.

For example, October's Monthly Report for [Kids.gov](http://kids.usa.gov/) shows the average CTR for Best Bets: Graphics on Kids.gov is 26.8%, while the average CTR across all DigitalGov Search sites is 14.0%. Their [graphic best bets](/manual/best-bets-graphics.html) are very effective compared to other sites.

See how Kids.gov's other modules stack up against the average below.

This means that the graphic best bets (such as seen for a [search on *George Washington* on Kids.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=kidsgov&query=george+washington)) are almost twice as likely to be clicked on Kids.gov than other sites.

It's important to remember your audience. [Kids use search differently than adults](http://www.digitalgov.gov/2012/08/06/how-kids-search/) and they're probably more attracted to graphic images.

Go to the [Monthly Reports](/manual/monthly-reports.html) page in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) to see how you stack up.

## Other Features

* We made the final cutover to our new Admin Center. As part of the cutover, we updated all of our [help files](/manual/index.html) and removed 404 pages from our search results. We also migrated our [Best Bets: Graphics](/manual/best-bets-graphics.html) and My Account pages.
* You're no longer asked to provide a phone number or address when you [register for a new account](https://search.usa.gov/signup).
* Librarians, developers, and others can see a list of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial [government URLs](http://govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/) that aren't .gov or .mil.

* We set up [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/){% external_link %} to identify areas of our code that can be improved.
* We phased out color schemes and now offer two options, default and custom.

* We added the [Digital Analytics Program](http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/) tag to our results pages by default. Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> if you'd like to opt out.

## Fixes
