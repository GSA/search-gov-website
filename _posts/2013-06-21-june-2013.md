We've spent the past few weeks doing some spring cleaning to improve our backend infrastructure and to lay the groundwork for a major update to our Admin Center. Stay tuned!

## Chores

* We started using the Rails [asset pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html). As a result of using the pipeline and some of the other chores below, we decreased the page load time by 25 percent.
* We upgraded to [Elasticsearch 0.90.1](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/0-90-1-released/).
* We upgraded to [Ruby 2.0.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/05/14/ruby-2-0-0-p195-is-released/).
* We updated the way we monitor [Phusion Passenger](http://blog.phusion.nl/category/passenger/phusion-passenger-4/).
* We removed some unused tables and columns from our MySQL database.
* We removed the legacy recalls code from our codebase now that we've released it as a standalone open source [Recalls API Server](https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api).
* We no longer require a valid API key to include API queries in your [site analytics](/tagged/analytics).
* We updated our list of synonyms to include fracking and hyrdofracturing as equivalent terms.
* The hyperlinks in the Admin Center system alerts are now clickable.

## Fixes

* We fixed a regression bug with [Haml](https://github.com/haml) and Ruby 2.0.0 that made the background color of the search results the same color as the page background.
* We fixed the CSS for the magnifying glass on the search box so that it appears properly in IE7.
* We now only show unique descriptions for CPSC recalls.
