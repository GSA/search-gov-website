## Improvements

* **Localizations Update:** We've moved management of multilingual support from the [GSA/Punchcard repository](https://github.com/GSA/punchcard) to the [GSA/search-gov repository](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov). Please read our [contributing guidelines.](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* **Security Updates:** We've improved security on some of our system components.
