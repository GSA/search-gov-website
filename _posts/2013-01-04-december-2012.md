## 2 Highlighted Features

### 1. Year in Review Email

Are you curious about the most searched for terms on your site in the past year? They'll arrive in your inbox in our new, annual Year-in-Review email.

We'll send you an email every December 15 (along with cheer and goodwill) with a list of the top 1,000 terms searched for on your site over the past year and how many times each term was searched.

### 2. Mobile Results Page Customization

Did you know that mobile search traffic increases during the holidays? 

You can now [customize the header](/manual/brand.html) on your mobile search results page to create a more seamless experience for visitors to your mobile website. Our new feature allows you to upload your mobile logo and specify a mobile homepage URL.

## Other Features

* Searchers see Bing image results followed by results from your [Flickr](/manual/flickr.html) photostream. (Example: search for images about [*hurricane sandy* on DOL.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search/images?affiliate=u.s.departmentoflabor&amp;m=false&amp;query=hurricane+sandy).)
