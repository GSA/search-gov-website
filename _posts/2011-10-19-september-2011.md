In September, we were busy laying the groundwork for an exciting fall.

Due to popular demand, all of your search results pages are now mobile-friendly.

We also rolled out a feature to index PDF files, the first of our on demand indexing features. Stay tuned as we will have more in-depth posts about how you can use DigitalGov Search to make your various content sources immediately appear within your search results.

As a reminder, we divide our work into three categories.

1. Features: Things that you actually notice
1. Bugs: Fixes to any code issues that may arise
1. Chores: Back-end improvements that you don't notice
