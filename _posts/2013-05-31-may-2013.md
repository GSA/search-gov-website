## 2 Highlighted Features

### 1. Search Your Twitter Lists

Does your agency have dozens of Twitter accounts? Do you have a public Twitter list for these accounts? You can now opt to [index tweets](/manual/twitter.html) from your lists. You can either:

* Show tweets from your Twitter account only (for example, index and show tweets from [@USDA](https://twitter.com/USDA) only)
* Show tweets from your account's public lists (for example, index and show tweets from the all members of @USDA's list, [USDA Twitter accounts](https://twitter.com/USDA/lists/usda-twitter-accounts)).

(Thanks, [NIH.gov](http://www.nih.gov) team, for suggesting this new feature!)

### 2. Search Your Multimedia Galleries

Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery?

You can now opt to [index MRSS feeds](/manual/rss.html) so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.

MRSS is the standard [media RSS specification](http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss) for syndicating multimedia content. So, even if you don't have an MRSS feed now, it should be easy to generate one as long as your content is in a content management system or other database. MRSS is also the standard specification used by hosted multimedia services such as Flickr, Instagram, Vimeo, and YouTube.

Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> if you have any questions about how to set up an MRSS feed to index your multimedia content.

(Thanks, [USGS.gov](http://www.usgs.gov) team, for suggesting this new feature!)

## Other Features

* For each result, searchers now see the URL directly under the title. The order is now title-URL-description. It had previously been title-description-URL.
* Searchers using screen readers now hear plain language labels for the search box&mdash;Enter your search term (English) and Ingrese su b√∫squeda (Spanish).
* When searchers opt to allow us to use their location, they now see [jobs](/manual/govbox-jobs.html) that are geographically closest them.
* Mobile searchers now see your site's display name as the alt tag for your mobile logo.
* You can now access jobs data in our search API so that, if you use our API, you can display jobs in your search results.
* Searchers on Spanish-language websites now see the [Jobs GovBox](/manual/govbox-jobs.html) when they search on jobs-related terms. For example, a Jobs GovBox appears on GobiernoUSA.gov for a search on [*trabajos*](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=gobiernousa&query=trabajos).

## Chores

* We updated how we index and store [RSS feeds](/manual/rss.html), including YouTube feeds, so that we index each feed only one time.
* We now return a Bad Request message for recalls API searches that specify a page greater than 20, which is [outside of the allowed range](https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api/commit/0539ce559cae7c4f9360f56dba91932bc48ebb4c).
* When available, we now [pull CPSC's URLs](https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api/commit/74ff28198b2e09418d9d0826fffdcb99bd7fd22f) for their recalls from their 301 or 302 response headers.
* We now filter out federal jobs with more than 20 locations.
* We removed the code for our forms feature on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov) and federal forms API. Follow [@ProjectMyUSA](https://twitter.com/ProjectMyUSA) to see how the MyUSA team is working to improve the public's experience with federal forms.
* We removed the code that created a separate mobile version of USA.gov. Visit  <http://www.USA.gov> to see its new, responsive design.
* We updated the cron script for our monthly analytics emails.
* We updated our stemming file.

## Fixes

* We fixed the pagination in our search API so that the API now consistently returns 10 results (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc).
* We tweaked the Spanish translations for the [jobs GovBox](/manual/govbox-jobs.html).
* We fixed the link for the advanced search operators on the [Spanish-language advanced search page](http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?affiliate=gobiernousa) to point to the corresponding Spanish-language help.
* We now correctly identify the Food and Drug Administration or Food Safety and Inspection Service as the data sources in our recalls API.
* We fixed how we handle registered trademarks in the recalls API so that searchers can now find items such as Zicam&reg;.
* We now provide a better response when an API call specifies the 'doc' index but doesn't include the required, complementary 'dc' parameter.
