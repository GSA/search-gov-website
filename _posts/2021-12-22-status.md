Date: 8:16AM ET - 8:21AM ET, 8:40AM ET - 8:41AM ET December 20 <br />
Details: From December 20 between 8:16AM ET - 8:21AM ET, and 8:40AM ET - 8:41AM ET, Search.gov encountered an error with a certain subset of searches failing. The issue has been resolved and Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: 12:02PM - 1:32PM ET September 28, 2021 <br />
Details: Beginning shortly after noon ET, during planned maintenance, some searches failed. We then experienced serious degradation between 12:29PM and 12:36PM, which appears to have been a combination of the planned maintenance and a DDoS attempt. After this period, some queries continued to fail intermittently until 1:32PM ET.

Date: 2:04PM - 2:38PM ET August 26, 2021 <br />
Details: Starting around 2:04PM, our system stopped returning search results due to a production push to update a back-end tool. Search results began to improve around 2:14PM ET as we redeployed our app servers. As of 2:38PM, Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: 3:01pm - 5:08pm ET January 11, 2021 <br />
Details: Starting 3:01 PM ET, a significant increase in query traffic caused our system to refuse connections. We added more processing resources to handle that additional load, which entered the herd at 4:04 PM ET and began to resolve the connection issue. The system is now fully operational.

Date: 2:24pm - 2:43pm ET August 25, 2020<br />

Date: 8:22am - 12:40pm ET March 6, 2020<br />
Details: Search.gov saw a large number of errors on sites due to an issue originating on our application servers. The issue was resolved by a rolling restart of the environment and Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: 7:02pm - 7:49pm ET March 5, 2020<br />
Details: Beginning 7:02pm ET, an outage at our hosting provider prevented us from distributing incoming requests to our servers. Their issue was resolved, but in addition, a database update by them to an unused feature caused our internal requests to fail. We applied an update to match their update, and service was restored.

Date: 8:00 pm October 29 - 10:15 am October 30, 2019<br />
Details: Beginning 8 PM ET 10/29, search sites using certain search features began returning errors for all searches. During our planned maintenance, our infrastructure host deployed routing settings to more servers than we requested, and this caused the error. After reverting the routing setting, all search sites are now behaving normally.

Date: August 20, 2019, 9:30pm ET - August 21 9:50am ET <br />
