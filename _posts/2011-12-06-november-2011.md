Happy holidays! We're happy to let you know more about our on-demand indexing features. You can now let us know where your new content lives (by submitting your new URLs, RSS feeds, or sitemaps), and we'll immediately display it on your results pages. You've been asking for on-demand indexing, so we're happy to officially announce this capability. Please check it out and let us know what you think.

As a reminder, we divide our work into three categories.

1. Features: Things you actually notice.
1. Chores: Back-end improvements that you don't notice.
1. Bugs: Fixes to any code issues that may arise.
