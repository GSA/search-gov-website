## Improvements

* **API Endpoints:** API users may notice that we have updated our documentation to show endpoints branded with api.gsa.gov instead of search.usa.gov to meet GSA branding requirements. Please note current users will not see any changes on their end. 
* **Indexing improvements:** We added a feature on our back-end that allows us to reindex usersâ€™ domains more easily.w

## Fixes

* **Security Updates:** We upgraded some gems in our infrastructure to address vulnerabilities.
