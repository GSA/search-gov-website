## Improvements

* **Click Tracking for Results API:** For users leveraging the Results API, we have released click tracking. This feature allows affiliates to track users’ clicks and view click data in the Admin Center. Implementing click tracking also strengthens the relevance ranking by promoting content that receives more clicks. Instructions are available at the [OpenGSA Portal](https://open.gsa.gov/api/searchgov-clicks/).

## Fixes

* **Internal bugs:** We addressed some internal testing errors that were impacting our development environment.
