## Highlights

* Weâ€™ve begun work on backend features that will provide new ways for customer content to be sent directly into our own indexes. In July, a new index was set up in our system. We also investigated ways to fetch, parse, and send data to our indexes. This is a long term project that extends through the rest of this calendar year and into 2018. Stay tuned!

## Chores

* We wrapped up refinements to our bot-blocking feature that was [released in May](/releases/may-2017.html).

* We continued work that will upgrade our server recipes to Chef 12 and our Ruby version to 2.3.

## Fixes

* As part of our compliance with Section 508 law, we increased the size of facet text on our search results pages. The guideline is that text should be at least 13 pixels, and our facet text is now 13.125 pixels.
