## Add Instagram Pictures to Your Image Results

Does your agency have an Instagram account? Your pictures can now appear in your site's search results.

Simply [tell us your Instagram username](/manual/instagram.html) at [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Content > Instagram. We'll automatically index all of the pictures in your account within minutes.


See the sample results below for a search for [*moon* on DOI.gov](http://search.doi.gov/search/images?affiliate=doi.gov&query=moon).

This feature is reflective of our commitment to bring your content, [wherever it lives](http://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/08/26/help-the-public-find-your-information-wherever-and-however-youve-published-it/), to your searchers.
