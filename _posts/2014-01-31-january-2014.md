## Highlighted Feature: New, Responsive Search Results Page

Our mobile search results page is now responsive. The new, [responsive design](http://alistapart.com/topic/responsive-design){% external_link %} ensures it is optimized for searchers on mobile phones and tablets. 

Use our customizable display options to [brand](/manual/brand.html) this responsive results page for your agency.

See the sample results page below for a search on *[tax on USA.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&query=tax&m=true)*.

## Other Features

* Searchers now see tweets from the last three days only. (It used to be 30 days.)
* Searchers now see shorter (up to 15 characters) sidebar labels.
* The HTML 4.01 transitional parser is now selected for you when you validate the HTML code for your header and footer in the Admin Center.

## Chores

* We migrated two indexes (best bets and supplemental URLs) from Solr to [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/){% external_link %}.
* We added more storage to our Hadoop cluster.

## Fixes

* We now show the menu icon on the mobile results page only when it is relevant.
* We fixed a bug with custom color schemes so that they're now kept when you upload images in the Admin Center.
* We fixed our advanced search operators so an exact phrase search now works for supplemental URLs.
