## 2 Highlighted Features

### 1. Tools for Filtering Results

The display of search results pages is constantly evolving. Some changes are subtle. Others are more noticeable.

In line with industry best practices and commercial search engines, we've moved the tools for filtering and sorting results to the top of results list (rather than on the left side). We've also added an option to clear all filters.

### 2. Access Your Raw Logs

You can now access your raw HTTP logs. These logs contain valuable data on searches, clicks and discovery tag page loads. 

Read *How to Access Your Raw Logs* for more details about how to request secure FTP access to your logs.

## Other Features

* Searchers now see the most current titles and descriptions available for [YouTube videos](/manual/youtube.html) and they won't see any deleted videos.
* Visitors to the pages search.usa.gov and buscador.usa.gov are now automatically redirected to [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov) and [GobiernoUSA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa), respectively, so they see the most recent content on these homepages.
* Spanish searchers now see [plain language](http://www.plainlanguage.gov) helper text.
* Searchers no longer see two search boxes on the search results page, which will create a more visually appealing and usable page.
* We open sourced all of the code that powers our [Recalls Server API](https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api) in Github.
* Searchers are now able to search and see results from collections that are not visible in the left-hand navigation on your "main" web results. You can use this option to provide a search box on a small subset of content (such as a policy manual or meeting minutes) while not cluttering up the left-hand navigation on your main results page. (It also helps reduce the likelihood that searchers experience a "dead end" on your main results page.)

## Chores

* We rewrote some query routing rules for job searches to present more precise results in the [Jobs GovBox](/manual/govbox-jobs.html).
* We configured [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) to enable continuous integration for the [Recalls Server API](https://github.com/GSA/recalls_api) and [Jobs Server API](https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api).
* We shortened the Jobs API base URL to `https://api.usa.gov/jobs/search`.
* We reconfigured our RSS feed fetching to update more efficiently. 
* We upgraded to [Rails 3.2.12](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/2/11/SEC-ANN-Rails-3-2-12-3-1-11-and-2-3-17-have-been-released) and [Rack](http://rubygems.org/gems/rack) 1.4.5.
* We upgraded our [Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products/cdh.html) (CDH) cluster.
* We removed the outdated yellow call out boxes from the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/).
* We upgraded to [Rails 3.2.11]("http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released).
* We upgraded to [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/) 6.3.
* We optimized the routing of search queries so that they're served by the geographically closest datacenter. 

## Fixes

* You'll no longer see an error message if you delete a site that has a YouTube profile or when adding a site that has no managed RSS feed.
* Searchers no longer see Did You Mean suggestions for your excluded domains.
* We fixed a cross browser compatibility issue on the Query Logs page in the Admin Center so that the number of clicks' column is now visible.
* We labeled the Safe Search radio options on our [advanced search page](http://search.usa.gov/search/advanced?affiliate=govbenefits) as a fieldset to improve accessibility for screen readers.
