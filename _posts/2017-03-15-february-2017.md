## Highlighted Features

* If you change your email address, we will now send a verification link to the new address. 
* We now offer a Kazakh language search results page.

## Chores

* As of March 1st, we only support federal and District of Columbia websites. We’ve done a lot of behind-the-scenes work to support our non-federal customers during the past few months of transition.
* We’ve added our active repos to [Code.gov](https://code.gov/), a website promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the federal government.
* Our sysadmins reduced the size of our Elasticsearch server cluster, saving money while maintaining system integrity.
* We removed old code from our system, wrapping up tasks from our December transition to Bing’s newest API.

## Fixes

* We fixed internal reports that allow us to track when agencies launch our service on their sites.
* We fixed a bug that affected the indexing of some [Twitter accounts](/manual/twitter.html).
