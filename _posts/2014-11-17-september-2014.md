## Promote Related Content as Value-Added Links

To help searchers more easily find what they're looking for, you can now promote related content by listing it as a set of value-added links under your organic web results. See the sample results page below that shows value-added links for EDGAR filings for a search on *apple* on SEC.gov.

![Sitelink-generated links for EDGAR filings on SEC.gov](https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/sitelink.png "Sitelink-generated links for EDGAR filings on SEC.gov")

Do you have related content that you'd like to display as value-added links that searchers should see within the context of each other (such as related forms, instructions, and publications)? If your related content follows a discernable URL pattern, email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> and we'll work with you to promote the related content on your site.

We've open sourced the [code for the sitelink generator](https://github.com/GSA/sitelink_generator) on Github so you can [fork the code](https://github.com/GSA/sitelink_generator/fork) and contribute to it directly. We've also [published it as Ruby gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/sitelink_generator).

Thanks, [SEC.gov](http://www.sec.gov) team, for helping us build this new feature!

## Other Features

* Searchers now see underlined links when they hover over them on the results page.
* Searchers using screen readers now see an [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/){% external_link %} alert for type-ahead search suggestions to let them know the number of available suggestions and how to access them.
* You can now add a tagline at the top of your results page. See the sample tagline, *NIJ.gov - Strengthen Science. Advance Justice.*, on [NIJ.gov's results page](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=national-institute-of-justice&query=dna). 
* You can now left-align your hamburger menu. See the sample left-aligned menu on [WhiteHouse.gov's results page](http://search.whitehouse.gov/search?affiliate=wh&query=bo). (Perhaps needed because [Obama is a leftie](http://time.com/3107557/top-10-lefties/){% external_link %}?)
* You can now add an alt tag to your logo on the [Image Assets](/manual/brand.html) page in the Admin Center.
* To improve its accessibility, you now see legends and instructional text for all radio button options in the Admin Center. You can also tab logically through all menu items.

## Chores

* We upgraded to version 4.0 of the [Airbrake gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/airbrake){% external_link %} and version 6.5 of [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux){% external_link %}. We also installed patches to address the [Shellshock vulnerability](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-268A).
* We gained 40% more capacity in our main Elasticsearch cluster by upgrading our hardware.
* We removed infinite scroll on the results page.
* We now redirect searchers to USA.gov's 404 page when they use a null or incorrect 'affiliate' parameter.

## Fixes

* We've added a user agent to our request headers so you can see it when we poll your RSS feeds.
* If you've opted to turn off web tracking, we now turn off the tags for both our own Google Analytics and the [Digital Analytics Program](http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/).
* We now show fewer similar or duplicate pictures in our image results. [[Commit f6ab915](https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/f6ab91539efa965325dbe02b6c67ff68a7dff431)]
* We fixed our image search pagination to account for really old pictures and how we group photos into albums. [[Commit b12eb19](https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/b12eb198c900d0d1a00c06a017477114b003489c)] 
* We also fixed our indexing of images with circa dates. [[Commit f7b577c](https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/f7b577c21daed4ac5b00711a70028602c4117d72)]
* We lessened the complexity of the importer logic for Instagram. [[Commit 5f828e3](https://github.com/GSA/asis/commit/5f828e3e426d66300fcff574ffecff262e9b4d73)]
* The option to narrow results to images only now appears by default for sites with an Instagram account. It had previously displayed only for sites with a Flickr account.
* Searchers no longer see government-wide image results on sites without a Flickr or Instagram account. They now see site-specific image results.
* Image searches without a search term no longer cause an error.
