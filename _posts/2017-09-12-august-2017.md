## Highlights

* Agencies can send content directly to our indexes via our [i14y API](/developer/i14y.html). Previously, each document had to have a created date. Now, this field is optional. Review our [technical documentation](/developer/indexing-api.html) for more information.

* We continued work on backend features that will provide new ways for customer content to be sent directly into our own indexes. In August, our team created a rake task that will allow our system to fetch, parse, and index a list of URLs. We also investigated the spellchecker functionality in Elasticsearch. This is a long term project that extends through the rest of this calendar year and into 2018. Stay tuned!


## Chores

* We completed our upgrade to Ruby 2.3.

* We continued work that will upgrade our server recipes to Chef 12.
