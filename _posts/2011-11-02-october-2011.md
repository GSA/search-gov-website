October wasn't scary for us. We enhanced your ability to immediately add content to your search results. You can now tell us about a URL or RSS feed in the [Admin Center](http://search.usa.gov/sites) and we will immediately index the content and display it on your results page.

Additionally, we now offer real-time reporting for your search queries in the Affiliate Center, allowing you to see your website's search activity throughout the day.

As a reminder, we divide our work into three categories.

1. Features: Things that you actually notice;
1. Chores: Back-end improvements that you don't notice
1. Bugs: Fixes to any code issues that may arise.
