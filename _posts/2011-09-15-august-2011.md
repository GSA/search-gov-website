While the dogs days of summer are almost over, we didn't let the weather stop us from rolling out some hot new features.

We we are currently beta testing two new rendering options: iFrame and a [Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/usasearch) which will allow you to host the search results on your web site and gain additional control of the look and feel.
