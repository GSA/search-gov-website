## 3 Highlighted Features

### Feature 1. Analyze Searchers' Click Behavior

Clickthru rates (CTR) can indicate the relevance of your results for specific search terms. You can now see (a) the CTR for your top 1,000 [queries](/manual/queries.html) and (b) your top [clicked URLs](/manual/clicks.html). The data are updated in real time. 

Use the data to find searches with low CTRs. For these queries, consider if a low CTR is good or not. (A low CTR can be good when searchers see the answer directly on the results page, eliminating the need to click on a link.) For those that aren't good, tweak your page's title or content, add a new page to your site, or add a [best bet](/manual/best-bets-text.html) to point to the relevant page on another agency's site.

### Feature 2. Analyze the Terms that Trigger Best Bets

Have you ever wondered what search terms make your [best bets](/manual/best-bets-text.html) appear? From the [Monthly Reports](/manual/monthly-reports.html) page, you can now drill down to see a pie chart of the terms that trigger each best bet. The data are updated in real time. 

Use the data to tweak your best bet's title, description, and keyword phrases. Or, use it to decide to delete the best bet altogether.

### Feature 3. Use Keyword Phrases to Show Best Bets Only When They're Relevant

Have you ever seen a [best bet](/manual/best-bets-text.html) when you don't expect it to appear? Best bet keywords are now *phrases*. This change allows you to show a best bet only when its keyword is an *exact match* with a searcher's query.

## Chores

## Fixes

* We fixed the layout of graphic best bets so results are shown in vertical, newspaper style columns. We also added more spaces between links.
* Spanish language searchers no longer see spelling suggestions for terms with and without diacritics.

* Best bets now appear even when there are no web results.
