## Highlighted Feature: Our New Search Results Page Is Now Available

Our newly redesigned search results page is now available for use by early adopters. 

Color pickers are in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/). You can customize each element on the page. 

Searchers now see [Related Sites]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/display/display-overview.html) on all devices, and you can designate them in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/). You can customize the label for the Related Sites link. For example, Kids.gov has chosen the label, *This topic on USA.gov*.

On the redesigned page, the [header and footer links]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/display/brand.html) are viewable, with the header links appearing in an expandable "hamburger menu." Additionally, [Graphics Best Bets]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/content/best-bets.html) appear in two columns for a clearer user experience.
