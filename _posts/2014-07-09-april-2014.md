## Highlighted Feature: Our New Search Results Page Is Now Available

Our newly redesigned search results page is now available for use by early adopters. 

Color pickers are in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/). You can customize each element on the page. 

Searchers now see [Related Sites](/manual/display-overview.html) on all devices, and you can designate them in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/). You can customize the label for the Related Sites link. For example, [Kids.gov](http://search.usa.gov/search?&affiliate=kidsgov&query=white+house+chef) has chosen the label, *This topic on USA.gov*. 

[![Redesigned Kids.gov](https://d3qcdigd1fhos0.cloudfront.net/blog/img/release-04-2014-kids.gov.png "Redesigned Kids.gov")](http://search.usa.gov/search?&affiliate=kidsgov&query=white+house+chef)

On the redesigned page, the [header and footer links](/manual/brand.html) are viewable, with the header links appearing in an expandable "hamburger menu." Additionally, [Graphics Best Bets](/manual/best-bets-graphics.html) appear in two columns for a clearer user experience.

## Chores

* We upgraded to [ElasticSearch 1.1.0](http://www.elasticsearch.org/downloads/1-1-0/){% external_link %} to gain some performance improvements.

## Fixes
