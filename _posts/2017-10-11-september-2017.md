## Highlights

* We announced the changes coming to our program in FY 2018. Read our [blog post](/blog/searchgov-blog.html) and [FAQ](/blog/searchgov-faqs-indexing.html) for more information.

* To accomplish our FY 2018 goals, we continued backend development that will allow your agency content to be sent directly into our indexes. In September, our team investigated multiple tools that can fetch website content, parse it, and send it into our Elasticsearch indexes. We also completed work that will ensure our new system follows “noindex” meta tags and headers if they are present on your website.

## Chores

* We upgraded our Ruby version to 2.3.5.

* We prepared to transition our program website to the [search.gov](https://search.gov/) domain. 

* We deactivated any users who had not accessed the [Search Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) within the past year. We notified inactive users prior to deactivating their accounts.
