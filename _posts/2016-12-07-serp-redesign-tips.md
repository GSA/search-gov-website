As you customize the [newly redesigned results page]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/serp-redesign.html) to match your site's [brand]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/brand.html), we thought it'd be good to highlight some of our favorite tips.

## Display Overview

[Search.gov Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Display > Display Overview

Shorter display names look best for the faceted search and related sites. Try to keep names under 15 characters.

* [USA.gov](https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&query=visas) has multiple faceted topics, and a related site for Spanish.

## Fonts & Colors

[Search.gov Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Display > Fonts & Colors

Use a background color on the header, page body, or both. For best results, use different colors for the header and body.  

* Your background doesn't have to be a strong color. A light gray can provide subtle definition as seen on [NIH.gov](https://search.nih.gov/search?&affiliate=nih&query=library).
* A good, strong color for the search button can go a long way, as seen on [Army.mil](https://search.usa.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=www.army.mil&sort_by=&query=troops).
* Especially buttons with a contrasting accent color like on [TreasuryDirect](https://search.usa.gov/search?query=gold&affiliate=treasurydirect).

## Image Assets

[Search.gov Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Display > Image Assets

A logo that has both the seal and agency name can provide a stronger identity than a seal only or a name only. 

The addition of a name can also give the same seal two very different identities.

* [NOAA Fisheries](https://search.usa.gov/search?&m=&affiliate=nmfs.noaa.gov&query=fisheries)
* [NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center](https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=nodc.noaa.gov&query=wilmington)

Align your logo so its alignment is consistent with your website.

* [NIH.gov](https://search.nih.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=nih&query=health) has a left-aligned logo on both of its pages.

## Header & Footer

[Search.gov Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Manage Display > Header & Footer

Use the footer to add navigation and required links.

* [The Department of Justice](https://search.justice.gov/search?affiliate=justice&query=law) is using this option.
* It's also possible to add an email address to the footer or header by using mailto:info@agency.gov within the URL as [USPTO.gov](https://search.uspto.gov/search?affiliate=web-sdmg-uspto.gov&query=patents) has done for its option to email the USPTO Webmaster.
