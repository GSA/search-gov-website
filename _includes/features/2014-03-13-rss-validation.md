We're working to improve the search experience for your [RSS feeds]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/content/rss.html). Below are the first two improvements we made. Many more are on the way over the next few months.

* Searchers now see only unique URLs in the News GovBox. (We previously didn't dedupe URLs that belonged to multiple feeds.)
* Searchers now see only valid, resolving URLs. (We previously didn't revisit your older URLs to remove those with 404 errors.)

See, for example, the Most recent... results for a [search on corn on ERS.gov](https://search.ers.usda.gov/search?affiliate=ers&query=corn&m=true).
