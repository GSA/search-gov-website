System security is a top priority for Search.gov. When you connect your search box to our service, we handle the incoming request load. You can be confident in our performance and security posture.

We have an ATO (Authorization to Operate) from the General Services Administration. Active customers can request a meeting to review security package documentation. Please [contact us](mailto:search@gsa.gov) with any questions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Services operated by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA)
are covered by the GSA Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).

See the GSA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy at (https://www.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy)
for details including:

* How to submit a report if you believe you have discovered a vulnerability.
* Bug bounty scope.
* GSA's coordinated disclosure policy.
* Information on how you may conduct security research on GSA developed software and systems.
* Important legal and policy guidance.
