        <p>This page details what people searched for on government websites via Search.gov during 2023. Reading the public’s searches in their own words allows us to understand how challenging it can be to navigate the government, when someone is not clear about where to look.</p>

        <p>Space is always a popular topic, and 2023 was no different. NASA relaunched their website in October, with a significant redesign based on usability research and testing. They implemented our new <a href="https://blog.usa.gov/less-is-more-improving-the-publics-web-search-experience-with-filters" target="new">search filters feature</a> at that same time.</p>

        <h3 class="review-subheader-2023" id="">2. Benefits</h3>
<blockquote class="year-in-review padding-x-4 padding-y-2 margin-x-0">13.2 million searches</blockquote>
        <p>One of the primary ways people interact with the government is to request and receive support. In past years, the topic of benefits had search volumes close to double that of other topics. As <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/updates/year-in-review/2023-year-in-review/overview/html#ssa">discussed earlier</a>, this year we saw a significant benefits-related queries decrease by over 50%.</p>

<p>In the data table below, you can see that one of the top 25 searches for the year was “redacted_ssn.” Social security numbers are personally identifiable information, and not included in public web content. However, people often search for individual social security numbers on government websites, so to protect their personal information, we redact the social security number from our system. This shows people search for social security numbers on government websites frequently, and not always to good intent. Some users may be looking to hit on an existing number that they can use for fraudulent purposes.

        <p>Health-related searches on government websites more than doubled between 2019 and 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, and have continued at this high level each year since. The search terms people use are very general, indicating a high level understanding of medical challenges and treatments. “Ivermectin” appears three times in the top 25 queries, showing the impact of social media trends on government information seeking.</p>

        <p>To receive services and benefits, the public usually needs to create an account with an agency system. Every year we see a consistently high number of searches for the login screen of these systems. Sometimes people just search for the word “login,” or “my account,” or sometimes they search for the name of the system. 2023 saw a decrease in searches for login and authentication compared to 2022. Though there is no obvious cause for this decrease, it may indicate that agencies are making it easier to find the login screen for their systems.</p>

Overall, in 2023 we saw a significant decrease in searches relating to updating personal data. We believe this is a sign of success with the many recent website redesigns.

<blockquote class="year-in-review padding-x-4 padding-y-2 margin-x-0">350,000 searches</blockquote>
        <p>People often need to replace a lost or stolen identification card. For many years, we saw a consistent number of searches related to this topic around 1.1 million. In 2023, however, we saw only 350,000 thousand. Normally this would not be enough to report as a top topic, but the change from previous years is remarkable. We credit this drop to the successful redesigns of many websites last year. Previously, people needed to search for instructions and forms, but now links to these resources are easily accessible on home pages and in menus.</p>
