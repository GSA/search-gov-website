Search.gov is a search engine service provided by the GSA’s Technology Transformation Services. Used by one-third of federal domains, we provide a high-quality, standard search experience for the public as they interact with different government websites. The service’s broad use gives insight into not only what services and information the public needs, but how people seek it out. Often, web analytics just show what resources people used. Search data shows why people went to get those resources.

This _Year in review_ explores the top needs of 2023, expressed in the public’s own words. For each of the TBD topics, we provide the **top 25 searches** in that topic.

The top five topics in 2023 were:

## Public Experience - How Do People Search?

**UPDATE** Search.gov’s broad use in government gives us a bird’s eye view of public behavior in search, no matter what website a person may have gone to. We see categories of need that link different topics together, as well as how individual people are searching: How many words do they use? How do they format their searches? Where do they start their search - from an internal page or directly from the home page?

Similar to every year, in 2023 we saw the public express very complex needs in very vague terms. **UPDATE** Sixty percent of all COVID-19 searches were done using just one, two, or three words. The most common pandemic-related search in 2021 was simply "covid" (25%), followed by "coronavirus" (11%), and, getting somewhat more specific, "covid vaccine" (7%) and "vaccine" (6%). Half of all pandemic-related searches were these four simple queries.

**UPDATE** One surprising finding this year is that searches in the form of a question, such as "how do I apply" or "what is my case status," have decreased over time. The rising popularity of digital voice assistants has led many to suggest that search is becoming more conversational. However, in 2019 there were over 8 million searches including question words, in 2020 there were 7.8 million, and in 2021 there were only about 5.8 million searches in the form of questions.

**UPDATE** According to data from the Digital Analytics Program, about 40% of visits to federal government websites begin with a search in a commercial search engine, and 20% start with a person going straight to the website. For people who then search on the site, we see in our data that one third start searching from the home page. Two thirds search from internal pages, indicating that they first browsed around before using the search. They also may have been on those internal pages after arriving from a commercial search engine.

**UPDATE** Since we don’t track individual searchers, we cannot show a complete journey from beginning to end. However, the themes and trends in site search data provide government with a considerable amount of information to improve the public experience with navigating government information.

## Methods

**UPDATE** The Search.gov system collects unsampled data about search traffic through our service. It allows us to see what searches were run on any participating websites. We’re also able to see what webpages people were on when they ran their searches, and what they clicked on from the search results page. We do not track individual people.

**UPDATE** For this report, we use an analysis method designed to detect the topic of the search from any of these data points: the search term, the URL of the selected search result, the website being searched, or the webpage being searched from. For example, a person searching for an application form may use the word "forms" or they may search using a specific form name, but select a search result from the website’s forms folder. We also consider how different searchers may use different words to talk about the same idea, such as "lost green card" or "i-90," the USCIS form number to apply for a replacement green card.

The time frame studied was January 1 - December 31, 2023.
