We call several different indexes when serving search results, and we present results from each of these indexes in a separate block, or module, on the results page. Each module loads when there are relevant search results to display. Each module has a code, and you'll see these codes in the Download Details csv files available through the [Queries]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/analytics/queries.html) or [Clicks]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/analytics/clicks.html) pages of the Admin Center analytics section. 

This page lists all the module codes and their full names.
