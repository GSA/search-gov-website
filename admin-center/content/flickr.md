## Tell Us About Your Flickr Photostream

Provide us with the *full URL* for your Flickr photostream. Most photostreams are in the photos folder (e.g., <https://www.flickr.com/photos/hudopa> for HUD). Some photostreams are in the groups folder (such as <https://www.flickr.com/groups/usagov> for USA.gov).

The URL must be for your overall photostream. You cannot specify individual photos, sets, favorites, or maps.

## Opt to Display Your Flickr Images

When you add the URL for your Flickr photostream, we'll automatically index all of the images in your photostream.

On the image results page, we'll display the images from your Flickr photostream by default. If you'd like to backfill them with the standard image results from your website, [email us](mailto:search@gsa.gov) and we'll turn on your web images for you.

***Pro Tips*** 

* Do you have a multimedia gallery on your website for your agency's photos, images, videos, podcasts, or other multimedia content? Do you use a content management system, database, or media RSS (MRSS) feed to power this gallery? You can index [MRSS feeds]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/content/rss.html) so that your multimedia content is automatically included in your search results.
