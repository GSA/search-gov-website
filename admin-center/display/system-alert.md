Find it in the Admin Center: [Search.gov Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Display > Search Page Alert

There may be times when you want to add a system alert to your search results page. For instance, during a [site redesign]({{ site.baseurl }}/indexing/redesign.html), you may wish to inform searchers that your site is in transition. 

Use the Search Page Alert feature to add a text message to your search results page, which will appear at all times above all search results, *regardless of the query*. Enter a title and text for the alert, set the status to active, and hit `Save` to turn on your alert. The appearance of the alert is not customizable.

## Suggested format:
* **Title:** `Search index is being rebuilt`
* **Text:** `We are launching a new example.gov. If your search does not return the content you expected, please check back soon for updated results.`
* **Status:** If you are not ready for the alert to be displayed, set the status of the alert to `Inactive`. Set it to `Active` when you are ready for searchers to see it.

See, for example, the custom alert on State.gov announcing their migration to a new system.

![Custom System Alert on State.gov]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/site/system-alert.png "Custom System Alert on State.gov which reads, Attention. We recently archived our website. If your search does not return the content expected, please check 2017-2021.state.gov")

***Pro Tip*** 

See also our closely related feature [Best Bets]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/content/best-bets.html), which allows you to recommend individual results or sets of results, which will appear *only when a searcher's query matches* the text of their titles, descriptions, or keywords.
