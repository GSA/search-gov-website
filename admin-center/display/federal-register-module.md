Federal agencies publish notices, proposed rules, and final rules in the [*Federal Register*](https://www.federalregister.gov). To make it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in government decision-making, we created the *Federal Register* module to help searchers find these notices and rules.

This module offers direct access to *Federal Register* documents. We pull the data from the [Federal Register API](https://www.federalregister.gov/learn/developers) to provide timely information across all documents.

If you [opt to show the Federal Register]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/display/display-overview.html) module, searchers on your site can readily find the notices and rules that your agency has published in the *Federal Register*, as shown in the sample below for a search on [*research* on sec.gov](https://secsearch.sec.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=secsearch&sort_by=&query=research).

If you would like to show Federal Register documents in your results, but do not see the toggle to turn them on, [email us](mailto:search@gsa.gov) for assistance.
