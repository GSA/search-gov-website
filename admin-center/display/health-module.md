Searches for health-related information are very common. We created the Health Topics module to help searchers find high-quality, authoritative health information.

This module offers direct access to [MedlinePlus Health Topics](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthtopics.html) and open clinical studies and trials on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/). To provide timely information across all health topics, we pull the data from the [MedlinePlus XML files](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/xml.html), which cover both the English and Spanish health topics.

If you [opt to show the Health Topics]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/display/display-overview.html) module, searchers looking for health topics on your site can readily find high-quality health information.

If you would like to show health topics in your results, but do not see the toggle to turn them on, [email us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov) for assistance.
