After you get your [search site set up]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/site-launch-guide.html) and we have your content indexed, it’s time to think about how you want to display the search results to your users. We offer two options:
 
**[Hosted Search Results]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/display/)** &mdash; *Recommended!*
  * Configure the branding, fonts, and colors of the results page using our Admin Center interface.
  * All our search features are available and maintained over time.
  * No developer effort on your agency’s part.

**[Search Results API](https://open.gsa.gov/api/searchgov-results/)**
  * To use this API to display results in your website's frame, you'll need developers to create a results page template in your environment .
  * You should also implement our [Clicks API](https://open.gsa.gov/api/searchgov-clicks/) to use alongside the Results API &mdash; this API reports click activity to our system and will complete your search analytics.
  * For searchers to use new search features we introduce over time, your developers will need to update your environment's results page template.
