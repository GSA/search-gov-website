Find it in the Admin Center: [Search.gov Home]({{ site.url }}/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Dashboard > Clone Site

The clone site feature allows you to create an identical copy of your current search configuration. All settings are carried over to the cloned site, except for images you may have uploaded for [Graphics Best Bets]({{ site.url }}/admin-center/content/best-bets.html#best-bets-graphics). 

Any users of your current configuration will have access to the cloned site.

The default site handle for the cloned site will be `OriginalSiteHandle_copy`. You will need to update this default name before hitting submit.  

Your site handle is a unique identifier for your site. The site handle is included in the request you send us from your search box, to let us know which search site to use. We also include it in the URL of your search results page, again, to show which search site is being used. We recommend making this handle short and unique, such as `nih`.

Handles can have lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores only. They can't have spaces and other punctuation.

If you'd like to edit your site handle after the fact, [email us](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov). Note, however, that you will lose access to any search analytics that were collected using the old site handle.
