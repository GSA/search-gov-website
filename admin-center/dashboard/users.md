Find it in the Admin Center: [Search.gov Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) > [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > YourSite > Dashboard > Manage Users

After you've [logged in](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) and [added a site]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/dashboard/add-site.html) with your official government email, you can add your coworkers to your site.

You can add anyone you'd like to your site &mdash; with or without a .gov or .mil email address. Email addresses outside the .gov or .mil domains must be associated with a business. Personal emails, such as @gmail.com or @yahoo.com, are not allowed.

[![Add a user]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/site/user.png)]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/site/user.png)

In addition to a text-based indicator, we use [color coding]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/color-codes.html) to indicate each user's status. 

{: .usa-table .usa-table--compact}
| Color | Status |

| Yellow  | Pending email verification: user must verify their email address via the introductory email they received from our system |
| Yellow  | Pending approval: requires manual approval by the Search.gov team |
| Red   | Not approved: to regain access, the user must be manually re-approved by the Search.gov team |
