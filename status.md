Date: February 14, 2024, 10:13-10:24am ET.
We performed planned maintenance on our database between 9:30am and 12:30pm ET today. From 10:14-10:24am ET, our app servers did not process requests. The system self-healed, and Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: February 8, 2024, 9:18-9:25pm ET.
Details: We performed planned maintenance on our proxy layer. We anticipated up to 25% of requests would fail during the maintenance period of 8pm-11pm. From 9:18-9:25pm we processed requests at 60%. Total impact was 3% during the maintenance window. Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: February 7, 2024, 8:18pm &ndash; 9:04pm ET<br />
Details: At 8:00pm ET, we began performing planned maintenance on our proxy layer. We anticipated up to 25% of requests would fail between 8pm-11pm. At 8:18pm a failure occurred, and we were unable to receive any requests for processing. We investigated and began a rollback procedure. The rollback was complete at 9:04pm ET, and we began processing requests normally again. Total impact was 18% during the maintenance window. Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: January 9, 2024, 5:03pm &ndash; 5:38pm ET
We performed planned maintenance on January 9, 2024, which caused a degradation in service between 5:03pm and 5:38pm ET. During this time, some agencies received degraded results, and some API users received server error responses.

Date: May 30, 2023, 3:30PM ET &ndash; May 31, 2023, 9:45AM ET <br />
Details: From approximately 3:30PM ET on May 30, to 9:45AM ET on May 31, our image search response times were very slow. Some browsers may have interpreted this response time as a timeout. The cause was a change intended only for local development, but which affected production performance. That change has been reverted, and Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: May 9, 2023, 9:06AM &ndash; 12:39PM ET <br />
Details: During planned maintenance the evening of May 8, we replaced a server. The new server received our standard configuration, but was never fully functional. When traffic began increasing normally at the beginning of the business day, at 9:06AM ET, the server's issues caused ripple effects across the system, without providing indicators of a root cause. We pulled the server out of rotation, and as of 12:39PM ET, search is now fully operational.

Date: May 4, 2023, 2:13PM ET &ndash; 4:14PM ET<br />
Details: From 2:13PM ET &ndash; 4:14PM ET, a misconfiguration in our DNS caused failure for search requests to sites using masked domains (e.g., search.example.gov, instead of search.usa.gov). The issue is resolved and Search.gov is now fully operational. We are improving our monitoring so this sort of issue can be detected immediately in the future.

Date: June 14, 2022 - September 22, 2022 <br />
Details: Beginning June 14, some sites using the Bing Web index started experiencing issues returning search results. Sites on the Search.gov in-house web index are not affected. As of September 22, Bing believes the issue is resolved. Please reach out to <a href="mailto:search@gsa.gov">search@gsa.gov</a> if you continue to encounter any issues or would like to switch your Bing-powered site to use the Search.gov in-house index.

Date: February 24, 2022, 10:50AM ET - 11:45AM ET <br />
Details: 
From February 24 at 10:50AM ET to 11:45AM ET, a small number of searches failed due to network anomalies. The issue has been resolved and Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: January 26, 2022 - Janary 28, 2022 <br />
Details: For a period of about two days, Bing searches intermittently failed due to an issue in the Bing API. The errors have subsided and Search.gov is fully operational.

Date: 7:10 - 8:20 ET December 22, 2021 <br />
Details: From around 7AM to 8AM ET, searches were intermittently failing due to an outage with our hosting provider. The outage is now resolved and Search.gov is fully operational.

<img src="https://search.gov/assets/img/site/yellow-status-intermittent-operations.png" width="15px" height="15px" alt="Intermittent Degradation" title="Intermittent Degradation">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intermittent Degradation <br />
Date: 8:16AM ET - 8:21AM ET, 8:40AM ET - 8:41AM ET December 20 <br />
Details: From December 20 between 8:16AM ET - 8:21AM ET, and 8:40AM ET - 8:41AM ET, Search.gov encountered an error with a certain subset of searches failing. The issue has been resolved and Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: 12:02PM - 1:32PM ET September 28, 2021 <br />
Details: Beginning shortly after noon ET, during planned maintenance, some searches failed. We then experienced serious degradation between 12:29PM and 12:36PM, which appears to have been a combination of the planned maintenance and a DDoS attempt. After this period, some queries continued to fail intermittently until 1:32PM ET.

Date: 2:04PM - 2:38PM ET August 26, 2021 <br />
Details: Starting around 2:04PM, our system stopped returning search results due to a production push to update a back-end tool. Search results began to improve around 2:14PM ET as we redeployed our app servers. As of 2:38PM, Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: 3:01pm &ndash; 5:08pm ET January 11, 2021 <br />
Details: Starting 3:01 PM ET, a significant increase in query traffic caused our system to refuse connections. We added more processing resources to handle that additional load, which entered the herd at 4:04 PM ET and began to resolve the connection issue. The system is now fully operational.

Date: 2:24pm &ndash; 2:43pm ET August 25, 2020<br />

Date: 4:52pm &ndash; 5:15pm ET March 5, 2020<br />
Details: At 4:52pm ET, Search.gov encountered an error due to an issue with data pulls for a migration. Service was restored once our clusters recovered at 5:15pm ET. Search.gov is now fully operational.

Date: 8:22am &ndash; 12:40pm ET March 6, 2020<br />

Date: 7:02pm &ndash; 7:49pm ET March 5, 2020<br />
Details: Beginning 7:02pm ET, an outage at our hosting provider prevented us from distributing incoming requests to our servers. Their issue was resolved, but in addition, a database update by them to an unused feature caused our internal requests to fail. We applied an update to match their update, and service was restored.

Date: 8:00 pm October 29 &mdash; 10:15 am October 30, 2019<br />
Details: Beginning 8 PM ET 10/29, search sites using certain search features began returning errors for all searches. During our planned maintenance, our infrastructure host deployed routing settings to more servers than we requested, and this caused the error. After reverting the routing setting, all search sites are now behaving normally.

Date: August 20, 2019, 9:30pm ET &mdash; August 21 9:50am ET <br />
Details: An internal DNS issue caused our web index to return "No results" messages to some sites in their web results module. We have resolved the DNS issue and all systems are functioning normally.

Date: January 30-31, 2019 <br />
Details: We experienced intermittent errors due to request queue volume. Errors resolved on retry. We performed maintenance on our primary index and increased the processing power for the machines that support this index.
