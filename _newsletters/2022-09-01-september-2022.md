### Review/Update Your List of Users

As we mentioned in our past two newsletters, we are conducting a review of our search sites’ authorized users, to be completed by the end of September.   

Similar to a user recertification process, we ask that you confirm that the users’ names and email addresses listed on your search site(s) are correct, and if this is not the case, to make any necessary updates. 

On July 26, you should have received an email with the subject line **From Search.gov: Review and Update Your Lists of Users.** If you have already responded, thank you! 

On September 26, we will be sending a follow-up email to those teams who haven’t had a chance to complete our [Touchpoints form](https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/touchpoints/58494327/submit).

Thank you in advance for taking the time to help us with this request!
