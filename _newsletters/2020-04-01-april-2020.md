## System Announcement

### Analytics Update: We Need Your Eyes!

For this update, we do not anticipate any interruptions in service.

## How We Work

### Prioritization Process for Customers' Feature Requests

One of our core goals is to provide the highest quality of service we can deliver to our customers. So when building our roadmap, we prioritize our secure and reliable infrastructure, aligning with compliance requirements, and creating a desirable search experience.

When we think of new features (the “desirable search experience” component), we gather requests from our customers through our helpdesk, focus groups, and regular check-ins. To prioritize these requests, we ask ourselves some guiding questions:

1. **Requests:** How many of our customers have asked for this feature?
2. **Utility:** How many of our customers will benefit from this feature? The more that can benefit, the better.

We take our list of feature requests and work with our developer team to understand what it takes to build each feature and prioritize these features around infrastructure and compliance requirements. Our developers are talented, but few in number, so prioritizing carefully is key to delivering an efficient and reliable service.

## SEO Pro Tip

### Schema.org Markup for Special Announcements

Schema.org has a markup method for urgent, crisis-related information called specialAnnouncement, and the major search engines are <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/march-2020/Bing-adopts-schema-org-mark-up-for-Special-Announcements-about-COVID-19">implementing</a> it <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/special-announcements">in support</a> of the COVID-19 response. While not for emergency alerts, "<a href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">the intent is</a> to cover the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation."

It allows you to feed them much of the same data you would include in an Open Graph block, such as title, description, date, and a url, but you can also indicate location coverage information and expiration date, among other data points.

Google and Bing can use this information for special handling. The specialAnnouncement markup won’t improve the SEO of any given page, but when a page ranks high, they may modify the presentation of it.
