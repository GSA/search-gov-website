### Focus Group on Faceted Search and Metadata-Driven 

Search As announced in our December Newsletter, we will be hosting a virtual **focus group on March 4 (11am-12pm ET)** to discuss **metadata-driven search and faceted search**. Based on the multiple inquiries we’ve received for this functionality, we want to know more about your search needs around these in-demand features. The objective of this focus group is to learn more about (1) how you manage metadata for your web content, and (2) how you envision using it in your search experience.  If you would like to participate in this conversation, please [contact us here](mailto:search@gsa.gov&subject=Focus%20Group).  To prepare, we created a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FOQKO2sza5tWhPaglHlXsiQSmg31sbck4XnPna6msyA/edit) for you to share information about your setup and needs. Please complete it at your earliest convenience, as we’ll use the information collected to inform the agenda for the discussion.  All are welcome to fill out the form, even if you’re unable to attend the focus group.

## SEO Pro Tip 
### SEO for Multilingual Websites 
There are several things you can do to help improve the overall search experience for visitors of multilingual websites. When it comes to multilingual search engine optimization (SEO), you want to make sure that your visitors are seeing the correct pages for their location. You also want to avoid duplicate content. Here are 5 recommendations to achieve good SEO for multilingual websites:

**Use dedicated URL patterns:** It’s recommended to use dedicated URL patterns that include a language indicator. The indicator enables search engines and users to identify the language from the URL alone. For example, an original English page might be www.example.gov, while the Spanish version could be www.example.gov/espanol/. The placement of the language indicator in the URL depends on the domain structure you choose. For example:

* Subdomain (e.g. www.es.example.gov) 
* Subdirectory (e.g. www.example.gov/espanol)

**Apply hreflang meta tags:** This helps indicate the language of the page.These tags can be inserted in the section of the original page or submitted via a sitemap. For example, an hreflang meta tag on an English page referencing a Spanish page intended for readers in United States could look like this:

**Use one language per page:** Multiple languages on a page could weaken the user experience. If the content on your page is in Spanish, make sure the header and navigational components are also in Spanish, and the `lang` attribute in the opening `html` tag declares the page as being in Spanish.

Important: Please **do not** put Spanish content onto a page with an English header and navigational elements and an opening tag.

**Translate your metadata:** Your website's metadata is a crucial piece of text that will help your site rank better. However, it’s not as simple as just translating the metadata word for word. What might be a keyword within the original language of your site, won’t necessarily be the same for your translated site. This means you’ll need to conduct further keyword research based on your target audience. 

**Make sure your website loads fast:** one of the relatively easy things you can do for your multilingual SEO (and SEO in general) is to make your website fast as it plays a role as a ranking factor for search engines.
