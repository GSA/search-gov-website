## Your Feedback Requested!
### Arriving In Your Inbox Tomorrow

Search.gov is always seeking feedback to help us serve our customers better - help us help you!

Tomorrow June 2, please **look out for a survey in your inbox with the subject like “GSA Wants Your Feedback” **sent from <a href="mailto:surveys@research.gsa.gov">surveys@research.gsa.gov</a> - it will have a link to our annual survey. We use these results to better understand how the program is doing, and how we can better meet your needs.

Even if you do not receive the survey, we would still love to hear from you. Please reach out to us by email, and we can send you the questions separately. Thank you in advance! ## System Update ### Upgrades Completed Ahead of Finalizing ATO Renewal We’ve been focused on upgrading our software for [Search.gov](http://search.gov/)'s back end, in anticipation of completing our Authority to Operate (ATO) renewal process. Our most recent upgrades include Elasticsearch, Ubuntu, Rails, and other smaller components to ensure reliability of continued service. 🎉

## What’s Next for Search.gov
### Inside Our Roadmap 
Are you interested in what’s coming up next for Search.gov? Who isn't! We’ve recently been sharing more about our roadmap during meetings with you, our agency partners, and it’s been so well received that we wanted to post the [roadmap](https://search.gov/about/roadmap.html) to our website to provide broader access to our plans. We take feedback from you, our agency partners, to find out what’s most important, and put together our roadmap accordingly. We collect your feedback through surveys (see above!), help desk tickets, and through conversation directly with you. Our goal is to support you better as we evolve, and to offer you the best possible service and experience. Please take a look at our [roadmap](https://search.gov/about/roadmap.html) and reach out if you have any questions or thoughts that you’d like to share with us!
