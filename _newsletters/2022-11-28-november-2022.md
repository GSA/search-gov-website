## New Indexing Support Feature

### Javascript-based Content Indexing Now Available!

As announced in our October newsletter, we can now index the full content of Javascript-based websites. This means agencies who take advantage of frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), which insert dynamic content into webpages, can use our in-house indexing, rather than rely on Bing results or other commercial tools. This will help you provide better, more comprehensive search results by pulling content from database-driven pages such as FAQ-management tools, or catalogs. Some of these publishing tools create complex page code that can lead to poor indexing and search experiences. Our Javascript rendering and parsing methods address this challenge to ensure clean, high quality results for the public.

By using our in-house index, you receive government-tailored relevance ranking and have control over the scope, timeliness, and content of your search results. 

Take a moment to [read our documentation](https://search.gov/indexing/what-searchgov-indexes.html#js-indexing) on how we support this feature. Your domains will need to be opted-in to use this new functionality, so please contact our team at [search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov) if you’d like us to start indexing your websites with rendered Javascript.

## Disabling Indexing for Twitter Lists

### Temporary Preventive Measure

We noticed some non-government content in our index, which had been harvested via Twitter Lists, so we’re taking steps to remove this content. We are monitoring the situation with Twitter, and have concerns about content integrity. As a temporary measure we will be disabling indexing for Twitter Lists for all search sites. If the situation stabilizes we’ll consider re-enabling this feature for the sites that had used it previously.

Not sure if your Twitter Lists were being indexed? If you checked the “Index tweets from my lists” option, we have been indexing your Twitter Lists. If you left this blank, or if your Twitter handle had been automatically detected by our system, this does not apply to you.
