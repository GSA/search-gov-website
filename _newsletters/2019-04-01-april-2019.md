We are pleased to announce a new help documentation package about indexing is now available. This package addresses the most common questions about our indexing system we have received over the past year.

## Upcoming Event

### First Webinar of 2019

On **April 25**, we will be hosting our first webinar of 2019. During this training session, we will walk you through our indexing process and the new indexing package. This is an excellent opportunity to ask questions. Join us at **1pm-2pm E.T.** to learn more about our service and how to make the best use of it.

## We Want Your Feedback

### Annual FAS Customer Survey*

You may not be aware, but Search.gov sits within the Federal Acquisitions Service in GSA. Every year FAS sends a customer survey. You will be receiving an email with the subject line "GSA wants your feedback!" which will contain information about how to respond. Some of the questions are specific to our service, and there are some general questions that FAS asks about all their component services.

We very much hope that you will take a few minutes to fill it out, and look forward to helping you in the future based on your feedback. Thank you!
