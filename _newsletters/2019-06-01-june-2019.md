## Summary

SEO tip about language detection, we fixed a bug in our result highlighting, and our intro webinar recording is available.

## SEO Pro Tip

### Going Greek?

We recently found out that our language detector is concluding that a number of documents are in Greek when, actually, they are in English. For example, pages with mathematical equations can be detected as being in Greek. The pages in question either lacked a language declaration, or it was malformed.

**What can you do to prevent this?**

We encourage you make sure the language of the document is declared correctly in the metadata of your page templates. For example:

`<html lang="en">`

We also encourage you to spot check the OCR text behind your PDFs, in case it says something like this:

INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PAPERS FOR THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 24TH INTERNATIONAL [REDACTED] CONFERENCE Ω Ω Ω πϕθ=Ω θ ϕ θ ϕ Ω ∫ ∫ = = = ϕ φϕ θ θθ Ω ϕθθϕθ θ ϕ θθ ° θ ϕ θ ϕ ϕ θ θ ϕ μ °

As always, we'll reach out to customers where we've found this kind of issue.
