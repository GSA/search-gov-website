## Good things are on the way

### New developments in Search for the coming quarter_

As you know, we’ve been busy over the past year building faceted search capability, redesigning our hosted results page, and improving our indexing workflows. We’ve updated our roadmap to share what we hope to accomplish this quarter. Highlights include:

- Release the redesigned results page
- Implement our first AI model, to better support searches for alphanumeric strings, such as form numbers, policy numbers, etc.
- Prototype a crawler, to complete the set of indexing tools available to us

## Collaborating with our customers

### Supporting search implementation for the redesigned ONRR.gov_

As many customers do, the Open Data, Design, and Development (ODDD) team at the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) contacted us to let us know they were redesigning [www.onrr.gov](http://www.onrr.gov/). We were happy to engage.

The ODDD team describes this collaboration on their blog post [_Planning and implementing a search engine for a redesigned government website_](https://blog-nrrd.doi.gov/search-engine/). We think it’s a great resource for other agencies that will be, or are already, going through this process.

It was a real pleasure to work with the ODDD team. Thank you for sharing this experience!

## Contacts confirmation

### Review/Update Your List of Users_

We are conducting a review of our search sites’ authorized users, to be completed by the end of September. Similar to a user recertification process, we ask you to please confirm that the users’ names and email addresses listed on your search site(s) are correct, and if this is not the case, to make any necessary updates. 

Like last year, this confirmation process will be managed using a Touchpoints form. We sent this out at the end of June, and will send a reminder next month. You can respond to either email! New this year, the form will ask you to indicate for each user listed on your search site whether they are federal employees or contractors.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to help us with this request!
