## Faceted search 

### Updated metadata documentation

Weâ€™re making steady progress on our faceted search feature, and are already collecting content from page metadata for use in search. To help you prepare your websites for enhanced indexing and search filtering, we have expanded our [Metadata and tags your should include in your website](https://search.gov/indexing/metadata.html) page. Please take a moment to review this documentation. Feel free to reach out to us ([search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov)) if you have any questions.
