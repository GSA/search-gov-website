## SEO Pro Tip

### Use a Main element to tell search engines where the real content is on your pages

We often get questions about whether we’ll index the text of headers and other navigation elements along with the primary content of a page. When a search engine loads a page, it will try to ignore all that redundant text and focus on the main content of the page. It does this by looking for a `main` element. There are two ways you can implement the main element:

`<body>Redundant header code and navigation elements, sidebars, etc.<main><h1>This is your page title</h1><p>This is the main text of your page</main>Redundant footer codeVarious scripts, etc.</body>`

Or

`<body>Redundant header code and navigation elements, sidebars, etc.<div role=&quot;main&quot;><h1>This is your page title</h1><p>This is the main text of your page</div>Redundant footer codeVarious scripts, etc.</body>`

Note that the div's role is main, not the id, name, or other attribute.

In the absence of a main element, search engines will grab the full <body> tag, which would then mean that your header, footer, and navigation text would be indexed along with the “meat” of the page.

Be sure you’ve wrapped the correct content in the main element. One site we indexed recently had done the following, which meant that we only indexed the title of their page:

`<main><h1>This is your page title</h1></main><p>This is the main text of your page`
