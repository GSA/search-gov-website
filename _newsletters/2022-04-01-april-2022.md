## Summary
Google Search Console access, new support email address, plan ahead your website redesign, share your feedback on the redesigned search.gov.

## Google Search Console Data
### Access Request

As part of the work we are doing on the faceted search project, we’d like to analyze the search terms people use to find federal web content. For this reason, we are hoping to gain access to our customers’ organic search data via [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console), so that we can understand what terms users search to find your content. This will also help inform our new feature development in the coming years.

Instructions on how to grant access can be found here: [https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7687615?hl=en](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7687615?hl=en) 

If you are able to share Google Search Console data with our team, please [contact us](mailto:search@gsa.gov).

## Reminder: New Support Email Address
### Use [search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov) to Contact Us

We have changed our support email address to [search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov) and are in the process of updating this information throughout our website. From now on, if you need to contact us, please use this new email address. Thank you for your patience!

## Plan Ahead
### Search and Website Redesign: Giving Us a Heads-up Is Appreciated!

If you are planning a website redesign, whether it’s an upgrade or adopting a new content management system, we encourage you to think about its impact on your search results. A good way to start factoring search into your redesign project is by letting us know ahead of time of your plans and if possible, the timeline you have set for them. Being aware of your redesign plans allows us to work together with you and prepare for this transition. To get started, we suggest you read our [checklist for a successful website redesign](https://search.gov/indexing/redesign.html).

## Search.gov Website Redesigned

Now we ask you to please share your feedback by completing this brief [survey](https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/touchpoints/47b65524/submit). As usual, your input is very important to us. Thank you for your time!
