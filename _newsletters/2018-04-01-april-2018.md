### XML Sitemaps and Robots.txt files: Quick Tips

- XML Sitemaps advertise to search engines what content is on your website.

**Tip:** Be sure the URLs in your sitemap match the protocol of the sitemap itself and the pages on the list

Robots.txt files help search engines find your sitemaps and indicate what you do and do not want indexed.

**Tip:** Be sure that the sitemap for a given subdomain is listed on the robots.txt file for that subdomain.
