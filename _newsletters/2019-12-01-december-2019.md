## You Spoke, We're Listening!

### Metadata and Faceted Search - Tell Us About It

During 2019, we have received many requests to implement metadata-driven search and faceted search in our indexing system. And we are paying attention! So the time has come to learn about how you are managing metadata for your web content, and how you envision using it in your search experience.

We will be hosting a focus group January 23, 2020 at 11:30am ET to discuss these very requested features and similarities and differences in metadata management across different agencies. If you would like to participate in this conversation, please <a href="mailto:search@gsa.gov">contact us</a>.
