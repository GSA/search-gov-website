## Action Item: Referrer Policy Update
### Help Us Better Track Your Search Experience

One helpful metric we track in your search experience is the URL of the webpage your visitors were on when they ran their search. This appears in the [“Referrers” table](https://search.gov/admin-center/analytics/referrers.html) in your search analytics. 

Previously, the default Referrer Policy allowed the full path of the referring page to come through, as long as the site maintained the same level of security (“no-referrer-when-downgrade”). As of late 2020 and early 2021, most major browsers ([Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/referrer-policy-new-chrome-default/), [Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/03/22/firefox-87-trims-http-referrers-by-default-to-protect-user-privacy/), [Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes)) now default to “strict-origin-when-cross-origin”, which means we only get the domain or subdomain as a referrer, rather than the whole path of the page they were on. 

If you do not see the full referring URLs in your Admin Center analytics, you will need to update your [Referrer Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy) to allow the full URL path to come through to us. 

We recommend setting your website’s Referrer-Policy HTTP Header to “no-referrer-when-downgrade”, so that you can see full URL paths and query parameters as referrers in your analytics. Read more about the [referrer policy and how to set it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy).

## Search.gov Website Redesigned
### Let Us Know What You Think

Now past 90 days after it was relaunched, we ask you to please share your feedback by completing this brief [survey](https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/touchpoints/47b65524/submit). As usual, your input is very important to us. Thank you for your time!
