## Summary
Do you have a transition coming in your web team? Follow these steps to ensure the new team will be able to access and manage your search.

##  Gaining Access to An Existing Site
### How to Access Analytics

If you need to gain access to the analytics data for an existing search site account, ask a team member at your agency to [add you as a user](https://search.gov/manual/users.html).

Please don't create a new search site as this action will not grant you the access you need. Thank you!

## Team Turnover
### Plan Ahead to Maintain Access to Your Search Sites

If there’s a significant change in your web team roster, please take the following steps to ensure uninterrupted access to your search site(s):

1.  Before a contract team turnover, be sure a federal point of contact has access to the search site. After the new team is in place, the federal POC can [add or remove users](https://search.gov/manual/users.html) from the search site.
2.  After a turnover, the new team should:

    *   Use a .gov or .mil email address.
    *   Contractors can use a business email address if a .gov or .mil address will not be issued. Someone with a .gov or .mil email address will need to contact us to confirm the contractors’ status. Once status is verified, we will approve the accounts.
    *   Personal email accounts, such as @[gmail.com](http://gmail.com/) or @[yahoo.com](http://yahoo.com/), are not allowed in our system.

If you need help, please include the search site(s) handles or ID numbers when you [email us](mailto:search@gsa.gov).
