## Summary
System improvements update (SERP redesign faceted search, JS indexing), hiring update, Google Analytics 4.


## Long-Awaited Improvements Update
### We’re Getting Closer!

We have some exciting updates to share about our upcoming features!  

_Search Engine Results Page Redesign (USWDS Makeover)_

We revisited our designs and refreshed them with user testing findings, as well as a component for the faceted search experience. We are currently exploring ways to support a React-based frontend in our current application. You can see the updated designs below!

[Mobile](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov-agency-collaboration/blob/main/results-page-redesign-2022/serp_redesign_mobile.pdf)

[Desktop](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov-agency-collaboration/blob/main/results-page-redesign-2022/serp_redesign_desktop.pdf)

For the header, we will support the [Basic](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/headers/basic/) and [Extended](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/header/extended/) USWDS components with simplified header links, and for the footer we will support the [Slim Footer](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/footer/) and [Identifier](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/identifier/) USWDS component.

_Faceted Search_ 

We now index the following metadata fields. Please consider adding them to your page templates to enhance discoverability:

*   Audience (dcTermsAudience, meta audience)
*   Tags (dc.subject, dcterms.subject, dcterms.keywords, meta keywords, article:tags, article:section)
*   Content Type (dc.type, dcterms.type, og:type)
*   Date (article:published\_time, dc.date, article:published\_time, dcterms.created, dc.date.created)
*   Domain
*   File Type 

We also will support three custom, Search.gov specific metadata fields to provide more flexibility. Feel free to contact us at [search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov) if you’d like to add these fields.

We are now working on searching and filtering using this new content. The functionality will be available in our Results API first. It will be added to our hosted search engine results page after the full USWDS redesign is rolled out. At that time you will be able to configure the filters for leveraging the metadata fields mentioned earlier.

_Javascript Indexing_

We have tested indexing of Javascript-based pages and will be ready to release this into production within the next few weeks! Domains will need to be opted-in to this new functionality, so please reach out to our team if you’d like us to start indexing your content with rendered Javascript.

## We’re Hiring!

In your resume, please make sure your work with technology, information/data/knowledge management software, user research and needs assessment, solution design, writing, and communication strategy (content design), etc., is clear so the HR screeners can see a match between your experience and the job posting language.

## Universal Analytics is Going Away
### Prepare to Use Google Analytics 4

Starting July 1, 2023, standard Universal Analytics properties will stop processing new hits. If you still rely on Universal Analytics, we recommend that you [prepare to use Google Analytics 4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10759417) going forward. [Read more about this change](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en). 

We have heard that data will not transfer from Universal Analytics to GA4, and also that the reporting in GA4 isn’t fully implemented yet. So our colleagues from DAP have recommended that we all add the GA4 tag to your pages as soon as possible to begin collecting data there, but that the robust UA reporting would be best to use until GA4 reporting has more time to evolve.

## Thank You!
### Review/Update Your Contacts
We want to thank everyone who took the time to go over their search site accounts and review/update their contacts’ information. Having this information up-to-date is really helpful to our team. Thank you!
