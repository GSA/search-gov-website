## Drupal Changes Coming Up
### Versions and Relaunches and SEO Implications, Oh My

**Drupal 7**â€™s end-of-life was originally scheduled for November 2021. However, given the impact of COVID-19 on budgets and businesses, this date has been extended until **November 28, 2022**. [Read what this means for sites on Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2020-06-24).

In that same announcement they mention that **Drupal 8 will still be end-of-life on November 2, 2021**. They believe upgrading from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 will be relatively easy.

If you will be relaunching your website, please contact us ahead of time by email at [search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov) so we can discuss and coordinate, to ensure your search experience transitions smoothly.

## The <main> Element and Other Semantic Tags
### Get Search Engines to Index the Right Content for Better Discoverability

Website structure can have a significant impact on the ability of search engines to provide a good search experience. We recommend you include [a few basic SEO components](https://search.gov/manual/how-search-engines-index-content-better-discoverability.html) on your website to help search engines target the valuable content and exclude distractions.

Particularly important is the <main> element. This element should surround the page title and the "actual" text of the page, and should not include any redundant text, like navigation, breadcrumbs, etc.
