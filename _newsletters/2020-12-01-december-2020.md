## You are invited!

### jQuery Update

We are updating our version of jQuery, which powers the <a href="https://search.gov/manual/typeahead-api.html">type-ahead search suggestions</a> you may display for your website’s search box.

We are planning to test this upgrade against sites where we know type-ahead suggestions are used, and **we invite you to participate** in the final round of testing in January, 2021. We’re confident in the upgrade, and while participation is optional, we want you to have the chance to verify the script’s performance on your websites.

If you are interested in taking part in this test, please let us know. You can email us at search@gsa.gov; detailed testing instructions will be provided when we’re ready for you to test.

If you are running jQuery on version 2 or earlier, please note these are no longer supported, so talk to your tech team about upgrading. To the extent possible, we’ve verified there are no conflicts between the coming upgrade and older versions.

**For All Sites**

The <a href="https://digital.gov/guides/dap/">Digital Analytics Program (DAP)</a> provides a web analytics tool (currently Google Analytics), training, and support to federal agencies at no cost. The team holds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd9b-GuOJ3nEz1NYl66orgVZIu17laKba">various virtual trainings</a> throughout the year and also offers an analytics helpdesk at <a href="mailto:dap@gsa.gov">dap@gsa.gov</a>.

**For Sites Planning A Redesign**

<a href="https://federalist.18f.gov/">Federalist</a>, part of the cloud.gov family is a platform for rapidly building and deploying highly performant, resilient, and secure agency websites. Federalist supports a host of different open source tools for developing and maintaining agency websites, and is built on the FedRAMP-authorized cloud.gov platform and Amazon Web Services infrastructure. With Federalist, the pathway to an ATO for deploying your website can be dramatically shortened by leveraging the <a href="https://cloud.gov/assets/pages/documents/pages-compliance-memo.pdf">existing GSA ATO</a> granted to the Federalist platform.

Federalist integrates with Github to automate deployments upon every code or content change, enabling fast iteration and easy collaboration among technical and product teams. They also support Github-backed and headless content management systems, such as <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a>, to help non-technical staff make content updates. You can bring your own codebase or get a jump start using one of their <a href="https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/templates/">pre-built starters</a>, which come with <a href="https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/">21st Century IDEA</a>-compliant design, <a href="https://search.gov/">search</a>, and <a href="https://digital.gov/guides/dap/">analytics</a> baked in.

If you or your team are interested in learning more about Federalist, or scheduling a demo, please reach out to <a href="mailto:inquiries@cloud.gov">inquiries@cloud.gov</a> for more information.
