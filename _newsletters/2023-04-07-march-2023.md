## Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Search Logs

### Check your analytics report

Customers may notice redacted Personal Identifiable Information (PII) search terms  in their Admin Center analytics reports. PII terms will be replaced with a label indicating the type of PII redacted, for example "redacted_ssn" or "redacted_phone". These logs don’t have any impact on searches. Your site’s visitors will still be able to search for whatever content they’re looking for. This update improves the privacy of your searchers’ data.

## Twitter API update

### Tweets in search results are no longer available

Twitter’s V1 API has been deprecated and third-party developers, including us, have lost access to their API data. Therefore, we’re no longer able to get tweets. In the coming weeks, we’ll work to remove the feature from the Admin Center to avoid any confusion for our customers. We thank you in advance for your patience and apologize for any inconvenience.
