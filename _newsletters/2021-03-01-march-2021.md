## Spring Cleaning
### Type-Ahead Suggestions Clean up

We have successfully removed approximately 825 thousand type-ahead suggestions that hadn’t been used by searchers since late 2019. Our system was not impacted by this action but customers may notice some changes to the type-ahead suggestions. If you have any questions or experience any issues related to this change, please contact us at [search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov)

## Product Update
**Our Roadmap for this Quarter:** See our [roadmap](https://search.gov/about/roadmap.html) for this quarter, now posted on our website. Built based on your feedback, it reflects what’s most important to you, and prioritized accordingly.

**Content Frequency:** If your agency is indexing with us using a sitemap, great news: we are now fetching content every two hours!.
