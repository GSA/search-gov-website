## Improvements

* **Date Filtering in the Results API**: We now support filtering by the document created and updated date in the Results API. 
* **Images in the Results API**: We've added the OpenGraph image associated with your website documents in our Results API response. This allows customers to feature images in API-driven search results. 
* **Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Handling Improvements**: We've added support to redact PII people may enter as search terms.
* **Results Page Redesign**: We've continued progress on updating our frontend components. 
* **Ruby Upgrade**: We've continued the Ruby upgrade across our repos.


## Fixes
* **Admin Center Analytics Reports**: We've identified and resolved a bug that prevented pulling monthly reports from the admin center.
