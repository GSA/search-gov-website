## Improvements

* **Search.gov Website Redesign:** On January 19, we launched a redesign to this website (<https://search.gov>). This site now uses [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) and features easier navigation to the content our users need. Please give us any feedback via the "Help improve this site" button at the bottom of the page!
* **Legacy Code Removal:** We've removed unused code associated with the [sitelink generator](https://github.com/GSA/sitelink_generator).
* **Security Improvements:** We've added more cybersecurity monitoring and support to our production environment.

## Fixes

* **URL Auto-discovery:** We fixed an issue with our auto-discovery of relative URLs for Favicons and RSS feeds.
