## Improvements

* **Decomission Twitter**: We've removed our Twitter integration from our search results page, Admin Center, and Results API. We updated our help site and API documentation as well.
* **Results Page Redesign**: We've continued progress on updating our frontend components. 
* **Ruby Upgrade**: We've completed the Ruby upgrade across our repos. 


## Fixes
* **Supplemental Feed Pagination**: We've fixed an issue with pagination for our sites using Supplemental Feeds for their index.
* **Missing Data Blocking Indexing**: We've fixed an issue that blocked indexing for URLs missing certain data.
