## Improvements

* **Implement Government Banner**: We've added the [standard government site banner](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/banner/) and our site footer to our [login page](https://search.usa.gov/login).
* **General Indexing Improvements:** We've improved our error handling when indexing domains, and now auto-retry domains that have intermittent connectivity issues.
* **ElasticSearch Upgrade**: We’ve begun end-to-end testing and infrastructural support for upgrading ElasticSearch across our system.
* **Developer Improvements**: We've made some updates and fixes to our developer environment to improve quality of life.
* ﻿**Instagram Removal**: Following the updates in our [April 2022 Release Notes](https://search.gov/about/updates/releases/april-2022.html), we've completed removal of Instagram code across all our apps. ﻿
* **Javascript Indexing**: We've begun prototyping support for Javascript-based content in the Search.gov index.

## Fixes

* **Result Count Display**: Instead of displaying the text "1 results" when only one result is returned, we now correctly display "1 result".
