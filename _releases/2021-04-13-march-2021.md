## Improvements

* **Security updates:** We made gem upgrades to maintain a secure environment.

 
## Fixes
* **Search as you Type (SAYT) Clean-up**: We resolved a bug with deprecation of old search suggestions, and have successfully removed approximately 825 thousand SAYT suggestions from our Elastic index database. Our system was not impacted by this action but customers may notice some changes to their SAYT suggestions. If you have any questions or experience any issues related to this change, please contact us at [search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov)
* **Youtube Channels Fix**: We resolved a bug blocking administrators from adding new Youtube channels to their search.
