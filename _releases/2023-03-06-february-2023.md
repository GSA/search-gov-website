## Improvements

* **Faceted Search - Results API**: Search filtering (faceted search) is now available via our Results API! You will be able to offer filters on your results page using text fields from our index, such as tags, audience, content type, and custom fields. Read our [API documentation](https://open.gsa.gov/api/searchgov-results/) and reach out to our team (search@gsa.gov) if you would like to start setting this feature up on your website.
* **Results Page Redesign**: We've continued adding backend support and begun developing individual frontend components.
* **Ruby Upgrade**: We've begun upgrading Ruby across our repos.  


## Fixes
* **Supplemental URLs - PDF Indexing Resolved**: We've identified and resolved a bug preventing PDFs being indexed for customers using supplemental feeds.
