## Improvements

* **Click Tracking for Results API:** For users leveraging the Results API, we have released click tracking. This feature allows affiliates to track usersâ€™ clicks and view click data in the Admin Center. Implementing click tracking also strengthens the relevance ranking by promoting content that receives more clicks. Instructions are available at the [OpenGSA Portal](https://open.gsa.gov/api/searchgov-clicks/).

## Fixes

* **Internal bugs:** We addressed some internal testing errors that were impacting our development environment.
