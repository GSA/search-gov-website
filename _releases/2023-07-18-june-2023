## Improvements

* **Results Page Redesign**: We've continued progress on updating our frontend components.
  * We built the new [Graphics Best Bets](https://search.gov/admin-center/content/best-bets.html#best-bets-graphics) component.
  * We added term-match highlighting to the backend data for results snippets.
  * We made sure that long URLs or descriptions displayed in a user-friendly manner.
  * We prepared backend data for jobs search results, *Federal Register* documents, and health topics.
* **Indexing improvements**: We changed the order in which we fetch documents, so that customer requests for reindexing will be prioritized over general index maintenance.
* **Results matching improvements**: In this phase we are looking at alphanumeric strings, for example form numbers or policy numbers. We created a Levenstein model of ways we want to match alphanumeric strings, to identify matches that are not exact but close enough.
* **Codebase improvements**: 
  * We deprecated our Twitter integration
  * We cleaned up some code that was generating errors
  * We removed the last code related to our previous Google integration.
* **Containerization**: We containerized a component of our development environment.
* **Infrastructure**: 
  * We improved our secrets management.
  * We improved our firewall posture.
  * We improved the performance of some of our security agents.
  * We updated gems across our apps as needed to maintain a secure environment.

## Fixes

* We completed some privacy-related tidying up.
