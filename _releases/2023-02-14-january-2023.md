## Improvements

* **Faceted Search**: We've added the ability to filter by subdomain and folders in our Results API. [Read our API documentation](https://open.gsa.gov/api/searchgov-results/).
* **RSS Feed Indexing**: We now support valid RSS feeds for URL discovery in our main search index, in addition to sitemaps. [Reach out to our team](mailto:search@gsa.gov) if you'd like to add RSS feeds to our index. 
* **Results Page Redesign**: We've added backend support and testing coverage for the redesigned layout. 
* **Gem Updates**: We've updated gems as needed for a secure environment.
* **ElasticSearch Upgrade**: We've done some cleanup in our code and testing tools after releasing the ElasticSearch upgrade.
