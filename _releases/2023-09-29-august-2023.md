## Improvements

* **Results Page Redesign**: Weâ€™ve continued progress on updating our frontend components.
  * We connected backend data to the user interface for our related sites feature.  
  * We renamed the new "Redesigned Display" page  to "Visual design (new)", and added guidance and navigation tabs.
  * We added the ability to control font settings on the new results page. You will be able to use one font for the page header and a different font for the results body and footer sections. 
  * We prepared the backend data for several features: [related sites]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/display/display-overview.html#related-sites), [videos]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/content/youtube.html)
, [RSS feeds]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/content/rss.html), and the custom [no results page]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin-center/display/no-results.html) guidance. 
  * We implemented the user interface for some features: jobs, no results, RSS feed, and videos. 
* **Results matching improvements**: 
  * We continued working to improve user experience related to searching for alphanumeric strings. We optimized our Spacy model creation to locate alphanumeric strings correctly.
  * We developed a crawler script to identify batches of documents to process through the Spacy model.
  * We added a Python testing suite to our data collector to prepare for future testing.
* **Spider investigations**:
  * We are now able to compare the crawl outputs of Scrapy with the same task executed in a local crawler app. This will help us decide whether to use Scrapy as part of our automated content discovery methods. 
* **Updates, upgrades, and other codebase improvements**:
  * We began implementing MFA for Kibana using GSA SecureAuth. 
  * We patched Elasticsearch. 
  * We upgraded Rails on one of our repos and our version of jQuery UI.
  * We updated some gems and removed outdated gems. We replaced the outdated gems with new ones as appropriate. We created a new RDS snapshot for staging. We updated Terraform and monitoring configurations for  ASIS and i14y in our cookbooks. 

## Fixes

* We investigated and resolved certain error messages in the database.
* We fixed our Java install process.
