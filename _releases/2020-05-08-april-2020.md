## Improvements

* **Search.gov Website Migration:** Search.gov now uses the [Federalist platform](https://federalist.18f.gov/) for its website.
* **Analytics Changes:** Our team conducted a series of analytics upgrades to align with the forthcoming Elasticsearch upgrades.
* **Rails Upgrade:** Search.gov now operates on Rails 5.2.4.2.
* **Infrastructure Changes:** We maintained an upsized infrastructure to accommodate a projected change in query volume due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

## Fixes

* **Typeahead Suggestion Updates:** We blocked certain query types from appearing in the typeahead drop down to protect user privacy.
