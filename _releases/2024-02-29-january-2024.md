## Improvements

* **Results Page Redesign**: 
    * We released our new results page in beta!
    * We resolved several issues related to display, and how results modules show up on different search tabs.
    * See the results page live on our own website with this [example search for "release notes"](https://find.search.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=usasearch&query=release+notes).
* **Results matching improvements**
  * We continued refining the web spider we are developing, which will support search on sites that cannot publish an XML sitemap.
  * We pivoted away from Spacy for processing alphanumeric strings and began experimenting with simpler methods. 
* **Updates,upgrades,and other codebase improvements**: 
  * We upgraded Resque and Kibana.
  * We completed deep improvements to our internal network.
  * We continued making progress on our new orchstration tool.
  * We removed segments of legacy code to improve overall system health.
