## Improvements

* **Legacy Code Deprecation:** We've scoped candidates for code removal to improve our codebase health.
* **Security Updates:** We've added additional login security improvements to our internal tools. We've also scoped work required to keep our Rails and Ruby versions in compliance going into 2022.
* **log4j Mitigations:** While our implementation was not vulnerable, we updated versions for components containing log4j and updated related settings.
