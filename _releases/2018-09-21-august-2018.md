## Highlights
* We began work on leveraging click data in our relevancy scoring. This will allow us to use the relative popularity of pages as a ranking signal.

## Chores
* We now record the domain of a URL that has been clicked in addition to recording the full click. This way we can compare the click volume of URLs within a given domain.
* We resolved security vulnerabilities in grape & sprockets
* Configure rspec to run specs in random order

## Bug Fixes
* None
