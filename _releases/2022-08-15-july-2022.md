## Improvements

* **Faceted Search - Metadata Indexing:** We've aligned on the fields we will support for faceted search initially, listed below. We've begun making the changes needed to support parsing and indexing this content.

  * Audience (ex. Researchers, General Public, Students)
  * Tags 
  * Content Type (ex. Publications, Articles, Press Releases)
  * Date (Created or Last Updated)
  * File Type (ex. PDFs, CSVs)
  * We will also be supporting three text custom fields that can be used for your website's specific needs. 
* **General Indexing Improvements:** We've improved our error handling when indexing domains.
* **ElasticSearch Upgrade**: Weâ€™ve continued progress on upgrading our ElasticSearch version across our system.
* **Legacy Code Removal:** We've removed some gems that we no longer need from our codebase.
