## Highlights
* Weâ€™re making good progress towards our indexing system, but all our work in April was in the back end of our system. See below for more information.

## Chores
* We have updated the jQuery version.
* We configured our analytics alerts to send emails via SES instead of Mandrill.
* We upgraded Ruby to version 2.3.7.
* We computed filename extensions for documents in our primary index.
* We improved how we handle email bounces for our notifications, and complaints that may come in.

## Bug Fixes
* We fixed and error with our S3 backups for Logstash.
