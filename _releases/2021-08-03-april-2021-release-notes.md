## Improvements

* **Ruby Upgrade:** We upgraded our version of Ruby to maintain compliance.
* **Security updates:** We made gem upgrades to maintain a secure environment.
* **Login.gov Redirect**: Before our integration with Login.gov, users were sent directly to their Admin Center Dashboard, or could bookmark a page within the Admin Center (like the Analytics dashboard), open that URL, authenticate, and go directly to that page. Our initial integration with Login.gov delivered users to their Account page after authentication. We’ve restored the previous pathways, so users can choose their destination, or be delivered directly into their search site’s Dashboard.
