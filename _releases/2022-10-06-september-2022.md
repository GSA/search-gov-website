## Improvements

* **ElasticSearch Upgrade**: We've continued end-to-end testing and infrastructural support for upgrading ElasticSearch across our system.
* **Javascript Indexing**: We've continued testing our support for Javascript-based content in the Search.gov index.
* **Filetype Metadata Improvements**: We've begun indexing the document filetype using [mimetype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types), rather than only using the file extension. This will allow us to use this information for faceted search and for results ranking.
* **Gem Updates**: We've updated gems as needed for a secure environment.
