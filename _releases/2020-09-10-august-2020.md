## Improvements

* **API Endpoints:** API users may notice that we have updated our documentation to show endpoints with `api.gsa.gov` instead of `search.usa.gov` to meet GSA branding requirements. Current users will not need to make any changes on their end.
* **Indexing improvements:** We added a feature on our back-end that allows us to reindex usersâ€™ domains more easily.

## Fixes

* **Security Updates:** We upgraded some gems in our infrastructure to address vulnerabilities.
