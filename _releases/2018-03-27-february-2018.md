## Highlights
* Our [new indexing system]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/searchgov-blog.html) has been in production since December! In February, we continued to release several features that are building on and improving our new system:
    * We have made our indexing rake task more efficient.
    * We began implementing indexing from XML sitemaps. Check out our new [XML Sitemaps page]({{ site.baseurl }}/indexing/sitemaps.html) to learn more about them.
* We made our title parsing more flexible, drawing from either `<title>` or `<og:title>` tags, depending on where a site’s quality title metadata may be.

## Chores
* We upgraded Rails for our core application
* We switched our highlighting of terms in search results to a much lighter method.
* We now have all apps enforcing HTTPs and are compliant with BOD 18-01.
* We removed abandoned i14y drawers.
* We improved how our indexing job updates records for existing pages.

## Bug Fixes
* We fixed an RSS feeds fetch issue.
* We have fixed the bug causing search sites to have access to the Best Bets of other affiliates.
* We disabled four-byte UTF-8 characters in Twitter results, and now support eight-byte characters. That’s right &mdash; emojis in your search results if they are used in your tweets.
