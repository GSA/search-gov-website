## Highlights
* We added a manual page about [xml sitemaps]({{ site.baseurl }}/indexing/sitemaps.html) to our Search.gov help manual.
* We created a [robots.txt files]({{ site.baseurl }}/indexing/robotstxt.html) manual page.

## Chores
* We have updated how we create and update the Search.gov sitemap.
* We transitioned our i14y repo to CircleCI.
* We increased storage volumes used by Elasticsearch 5.6.4.
* We open-sourced the usasearch application, which is now known as [search-gov](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov).
* We are now sending our email notifications via AWS Simple Email Service (SES).
* We setup a metrics dashboard for SES emails.

## Bug Fixes
* We removed all Rspec/VCR dependencies on actual private keys.
* We removed the link to Search.gov website from the "Powered by Search.gov" logo that appears at the bottom of our hosted SERPs.
